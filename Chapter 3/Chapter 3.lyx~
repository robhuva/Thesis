Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
This chapter examines the Self-Organising Map (SOM) technique and how it
 is utilised in climatology in general, and how it has been applied in the
 context of Australia.

\change_inserted -1458100629 1416185995
 The SOM algorithm is described in full and previous research comparing
 the preformance of the SOM to other commonly used techniques is presented.

\change_unchanged
 This chapter also introduces the reanalysis data used for Part 1 and the
 performance of the data in comparison to other data sets.

\begin_layout Standard
First proposed by Teuvo Kohonen in the late 1980’s the SOM acts in a similar
 manner to most data reduction techniques in its attempt to synthesise a
 large multidimensional data-set into a series of discrete, commonly occurring,
 modes of variability.
 With its origins in the study of brain activity, the SOM can also be called
 an artificial neural network due to its 2D grouping of cells that are specifica
lly tuned by various input signals (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Kohonen1990"

\end_inset

).
 By successively 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

showing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the data to the SOM array and then altering the 2D array to look more like
 the data, the SOM technique aims to identify specific patterns from within
 the data that are the most common.

The seminal use of SOMs in synoptic climatology was by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 used the SOM technique to categorise a gridded Mean Sea-Level Pressure
 (MSLP) data-set of the northeast United States into 35 archetypal pressure
 distributions.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hewitson2002"

\end_inset

 found the SOM to be a very useful method for determining common synoptic
 regimes as it presented an array of pressure maps that span the data-space
 and thus a continuum of synoptic maps was produced rather than, say, a
 group of clusters that have less obvious relationships to one another.
 Since 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hewitson2002"

\end_inset

 the SOM technique has become increasingly popular in climatology; a field
 in which it is more popular to find Principle Component based clustering
 techniques (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Sheridan2011"

\end_inset

).
 Specifically, the SOM has been widely used for the study of pressure patterns
 that co-occur with precipitation events (

SOM Methodology

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -1458100629 1418104995
The training of the SOM in the current study occurred in two main phases,
 in accordance with the suggestions from the software and the works of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hewitson2002"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Alexander2010"

\end_inset

.
 The first phase involved a random initialisation of each SOM node, followed
 by training with the data.
 The training in the SOM algorithm is conducted by sequentially presenting
 the time-steps from the data to be mapped (in this case the ERA-Interim
 MSLP data), followed by a search for the SOM node that best matches each
 data sample.
 The node that best matches (hereafter referred to as the Best Matching
 Unit 
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "BMU"
description "Best Matching Unit"

\end_inset

(BMU)) is determined by the Euclidean distance measurement; shown here in
 Eq.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}

c & = & arg\,\underset{i}{min}\left\{ \text{ǁ}x-m_{i}\text{ǁ}\right\} \label{eq:1-BMU}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -1458100629 1415864391
where 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the argument of the winning node, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the data sample and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the node that 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is being compared with; indicating that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{c}$
\end_inset

 would be the BMU.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -1458100629 1423014903
The BMU and the nodes that surround the BMU are then altered to look more
 like the data.
 The amount the nodes are altered by is determined by two parameters: namely,
 the alpha value and radius value.
 The alpha value decreases linearly from an initial value to zero during
 training and the radius value is given the value of the smallest dimension
 size of the SOM in training phase one.
 In this thesis the choice was made to utilise a Gaussian approach to node
 alteration (Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:3-Gaussian-Function"

\end_inset

).
 In the Gaussian approach the alpha and radius values control the decay
 rate of the Gaussian function, centred on the BMU, such that nodes immediately
 surrounding the BMU are altered much more than those further away in the
 SOM space.
 An alternative approach to the Gaussian utilises just a monotonically decreasin
g function of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ci}(t)=\alpha(t)$
\end_inset

 only) and is termed the 'Bubble' approach.
 In this thesis the Gaussian approach was selected because it was found
 to produce SOMs with consistently smaller Euclidean distances to the original
 data (not shown).
 The amount that each node is altered can be described by Eqs.
 2 and 3 from

The second training phase is conducted in a similar manner to that of the
 first phase, with the exception that the starting point of the SOM is the
 state of the SOM at the end of the first training phase.
 In the second phase the run length is also increased to be 10 times the
 number of time steps in the data, the radius value is reduced to one and
 the alpha value is half that of the initial alpha value.
 The second training phase could therefore be thought of as a process for
 adding in the finer detail that is missed from the initial training phase.

The outcome of the SOM procedure is a matrix of related MSLP distributions.
 The size of the matrix (number of nodes in the SOM space) is predetermined
 by the user and once established the SOM nodes can be mapped back onto
 the original data (assigning a SOM node to each time step via the BMU method).
 The mapping of the SOM nodes back onto the original data converts the data
 into a time series of SOM nodes (weather types), allowing for the time-wise
 behaviour of common weather types to be examined.
 In the case of this thesis, the SOM method enables the identification of
 common characteristics in an otherwise complicated MSLP dataset, which
 in turn also enables a study of related variables (wind and solar) and
 how they vary in association with the common weather types.

With the results from previous studies in mind it was decided that the SOM
 would also be a suitable technique for the current study.
 The SOM's ability to summarise large data sets into a limited number of
 commonly occurring weather types (via the MSLP field) was identified as
 being useful for analysing the common wind and solar distributions, as
 well.
 In a similar manner to the studies of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 later chapters identify common MSLP patterns.
 However, instead of analysing the co-occurrence of precipitation, the wind
 speed or solar irradiance fields are analysed for how they relate to the
 common weather regimes.

Synthesis of a large data set into a limited number of commonly occuring
 features of that data set is a process frequently utilised in science,
 and in particular climatology.
 While the SOM technique has only recently been applied to the field of
 climatology there are other techniques, for the purposes of data synthesis,
 that have been in use for much longer.
 One such technique is Principle Component Analysis 
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "PCA"
description "Principle Component Analysis"

\end_inset

(PCA).
 A study comparing the PCA technique to the SOM was recently conducted for
 eastern Australia by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jiang2012"

\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 used PCA analysis to estimate the number of weather types needed for eastern
 Australia (12) and then use k-means clustering to form 12 clusters/synoptic
 types of the 1958-2009 NCEP/NCAR reanlysis 100hPa geopotential height.
 For the SOM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 use the standard procedure of two-phase training, like that outlined above.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jiang2012"

\end_inset

 then utilised a 12-node SOM for comparison with the 12 clusters from the
 PCA analysis (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jiang2012"

\end_inset

 also tests a 20-node SOM).
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jiang2012"

\end_inset

 found that in general the SOM technique had more advantages than the PCA-cluste
ring approach.
 In particular it was highlighted that the SOM can be used as a clustering
 tool if the radius (
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

) is set to zero, and when utilised in this way the SOM had similar performance
 to the k-means clustering approach.
 Where the SOM differed was in its ability to produce transition patterns---geop
otential height patterns that fall between the dominant features.
 By spanning the data space the SOM is more useful for studies that want
 to analyse weather pattern trajectories, as well as studies that wish to
 understand the influence of more subtle features (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jiang2012"

\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Standard

In a similar study, but for the European region, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 also found the SOM to be more advantageous than the PCA approach.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Rousi2013"

\end_inset

 found that the both the SOM and the PCA were able to identify the main
 mode of variability for the region (the North Atlantic Oscillation), but
 that the SOM was able to also identify smaller features that the PCA missed
 because of its more discrete representation---a similar finding to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 Other techniques also exist for the purposes of data synthesis, including
 simmulated annealing clustering.

 however, a direct comparison of this technique with the SOM appears not

It has been shown that for the purposes of this thesis the SOM technique
 will be an appropriate tool for classifying the major, as well as the transitio
nal, modes of variability for the Australian region.
 By capturing both the major modes of variability, as well as transitions
 therein, the SOM will provide a comprehensive assessment of synoptic scale
 variance over Australia.
 The SOM will therefore also enable a comprehensive assessment of the synoptic
 scale influences on wind speed and solar iradiance.

 reanalysis products are superior to other global products, such as high-resolut
ion operational forecasting systems, for studies into the long-term climate
 because reanalyses do not involve the continual adjustment to higher resolution
 systems that follow improvements in computing power.
 Rather, reanalysis products offer a stable platform upon which a single
 version of the data assimilation system is used (

).
 It is for this reason that reanalysis products are able to provide a long-term
 and coherent record of the global atmospheric circulation (

Having said that, reanalysis products are far from fault-free.
 Indeed the analysis systems suffer from model biases, limits to and changes
 in the coverage of observations and thus for some variables the analysis
 of long-term trends can produce spurious results (

The ERA-Interim reanalysis used in the current study is the third global
 reanalysis that has been produced by ECMWF.
 As noted in

 ERA-Interim improves upon the previous reanalysis product, ERA-40, in many
 aspects.
 For instance, in ERA-Interim the atmospheric model is coupled to an ocean-wave
 model, which was not the case in ERA-40 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Berrisford2009"

\end_inset

).
 ERA-Interim also includes the introduction of 4-dimensional variational
 analysis (4D-Var) and a variational bias correction scheme for satellite-derive
d radiances---both of which were not included in ERA-40.
 As a consequence,

 were also able to show that the background departures, defined as being
 the difference between the forecast of the next observation and the observation
, are smaller in ERA-Interim.

 also reported some decreasing trends in surface winds for ERA-Interim for
 the period 1992-2002 when compared to the European Remote Sensing sattelite
 and QuickScat data---although the trends then reveresed after 2002, noted
 as likely due to the evolution in the observing system.
 Some analysis presented below shows that the relatively coarse resolution
 of the ERA-Interim model (~80km spatially) compares well to the former
 regional model of the Bureau of Meteorology (MesoLAPS_125, 12.5km spatially)
 for the same dates (Fig,

 While Fig.

 is not a comparison with observations it does test model resolution dependence-
--showing that for large scale features the ERA-Interim resolution captures
 that which a finer model resolution can capture.

 most prevelant over the ocean.
 Over land areas---the primary concern of this thesis is the Australian

 Indeed, while the surface energy balance over the ocean might be poor in
 ERA-Interim when compared to ERA-40,

 were able to show that the ERA-Interim spatial structures and the representatio

 have improved from ERA-40.
 While analysis systems are not designed to conserve quantities like energy,
 mass and angular momentum, in general the ERA-Interim budget closure is
 better than ERA-40 (

While there are noted model biases and innevitable flaws in the process
 of running a global model with inconsistent observational coverage, it
 should be stressed that such challenges are present for all reanalysis
 systems, not just ERA-Interim.
 In previous paragraphs the ERA-interim reanalysis archive has been shown
 to perform well in a number of relevant variables for this thesis.
 As such, for the purposes of Part 1---synoptic typing of MSLP and the large-sca
le interpretation of coincident DSR and near-surface wind speed for Australia---
the ERA-Interim reanalysis will be used.
