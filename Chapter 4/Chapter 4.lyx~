Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
This chapter examines the common synoptic weather regimes of the Australian
 region by means of a Self-Organising Map (SOM) of the Mean Sea-Level Pressure
 (MSLP) field from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts
 (ECMWF) product, ERA-Interim.
 An examination of the SOM technique's effectiveness is undertaken, along
 with the presentation of an improvement to the use of the SOM in this thesis.

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter presents the results from training SOMs of various sizes and
 initial values with MSLP data from ERA-Interim, and for the whole domain
 covering Australia with dimensions (6ºS,105ºE) → (49.5ºS,165ºE).
 The SOM of the whole domain is shown to be consistent with other studies
 using the technique for the Austral region.
 However, in the current study there is no expectation that offshore locations
 be utilised for wind or solar power as the vast majority of the Australian
 coastline has steep ocean floor gradients (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Diesendorf2006"

\end_inset

).
 Hence an alternative SOM that utilises only the data over the Australian
 continent is also presented.
 The alternative SOM is also shown to be more effective at classifying the
 original data.
 This chapter is structured as follows.

The training of the SOM in the current study occurred in two main phases,
 in accordance with the suggestions from the software and the works of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hewitson2002"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Alexander2010"

\end_inset

.
 The first phase involved a random initialisation of each SOM node, followed
 by training with the data.
 The training in the SOM algorithm (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Kohonen1995"

\end_inset

 for a more rigorous derivation of the algorithm) is conducted by sequentially
 presenting the time-steps from the data to be mapped (in this case the
 ERA-Interim MSLP data), followed by a search for the SOM node that best
 matches each data sample.
 The node that best matches (hereafter referred to as the Best Matching
 Unit (BMU)) is determined by the Euclidean distance measurement; shown
 here in Eq.

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted -1458100629 1415864383
The BMU and the nodes that surround the BMU are then altered to look more
 like the data.
 The amount the nodes are altered by is determined by two parameters: namely,
 the alpha value and radius value.
 The alpha value decreases linearly from an initial value to zero during
 training and the radius value is given the value of the smallest dimension
 size of the SOM in training phase one.
 In this thesis the choice was made to utilise a Gaussian approach to node
 alteration.
 In the Gaussian approach the alpha and radius values control the decay
 rate of a Gaussian function, centred on the BMU, such that nodes immediately
 surrounding the BMU are altered much more than those further away in the
 SOM space.
 The amount that each node is altered can be described by Eqs.

 Each successive pass of the data alters the BMU and surrounding nodes,

The second training phase is conducted in a similar manner to that of the
 first phase, with the exception that the starting point of the SOM is the
 state of the SOM at the end of the first training phase.
 In the second phase the run length is also increased to be 10 times the
 number of time steps in the data, the radius value is reduced to one and
 the alpha value is half that of the initial alpha value.
 The second training phase could therefore be thought of as a process for
 adding in the finer detail that is missed from the initial training phase.

The outcome of the SOM procedure is a matrix of related MSLP distributions.
 The size of the matrix (number of nodes in the SOM space) is predetermined
 by the user and once established the SOM nodes can be mapped back onto
 the original data (assigning a SOM node to each time step via the BMU method).
 The mapping of the SOM nodes back onto the original data converts the data
 into a time series of SOM nodes (weather types), allowing for the time-wise
 behaviour of common weather types to be examined.
 In the case of this thesis, the SOM method enables the identification of
 common characteristics in an otherwise complicated MSLP dataset, which
 in turn also enables a study of related variables (wind and solar) and
 how they vary in association with the common weather types.

The whole domain SOM (land and ocean grid points) was created by simply
 showing all of the available MSLP data to the training process.
 However, the continental SOM was created by only analysing the variability
 over the Australian continent.
 The domain for the continental version was also reduced to exclude some
 of the land north of the Australian continent that was included in the
 whole domain version.
 The refined domain, (10.5ºS, 105ºE) → (49.5ºS, 165ºE), for the continental
 version is shown in Fig.

Throughout the thesis the quantised error measurement is used to compare
 time steps with their closest matching SOM node.
 The pattern correlation technique was tested for this purpose, however
 was not seen to perform any better than quantised error/Euclidean distance
 measure (not shown).
 The main weakness of the pattern correlation technique was its insensitivity
 to magnitude.

--that the extent of one spatial dimension always be bigger than the other

 Indeed there are any number of possible SOM shapes (for instance,

 The shape of the SOM (number of rows and columns) is predetermined by the

Twenty random initialisations for each whole domain SOM in training phase
 one were also experimented with to test for convergence of the final results.
 The random initialisation, however, was seen to have very little effect
 on the final average quantised error for each radius-alpha combination
 (all differences were in the range of ±2.94hPa for the whole domain).
 It is thought that even though various random initialisations were explored,
 the final run length (306,800) is long enough to produce approximately
 the same SOM space in spite of any differences in initialisation.

 a process for deciding which SOM size to use for later calculations was
 undertaken.
 The aim of the decision process for SOM size was to determine which of
 the above SOM sizes represented enough of the data space to accurately
 describe MSLP variability over the Austral domain, but at the same time
 did not have too many nodes to easily visualise.

 in their proposal for the use of SOMs in climatology suggested that a subjectiv
e choice can be just as effective as a mathematical criterion for selecting
 the ‘optimum’ number of nodes to use.
 This suggestion by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hewitson2002"

\end_inset

 was brought about by the observation that the same broad groupings appear
 with all SOM sizes and that the number of nodes simply determines the degree
 of generalisation---a characteristic that was also observed in the current
 study (not shown).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite this assertion from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Hewitson2002"

\end_inset

, there are known and tested methods for objectively or even semi-objectively
 determining how many sub-groupings of a data set is the optimal amount
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Tibshirani2001"

\end_inset

 for examples).
 For instance, conventional clustering analysis provides many proposed methods
 for determine how many clusters to utilise.
 But given that the SOM technique does not cluster in the traditional sense
 and instead represents a smooth continuum of nodes that span the data-space,
 such techniques from clustering analysis were not seen to be entirely applicabl
e to the SOM technique, and thus not applicable to this thesis.

As noted by

 the ‘elbow’ phenomenon is a common way of determining the point at which
 the addition of more clusters/nodes gives no appreciable increase in the
 amount of the data-space represented by all clusters/nodes.
 In terms of the analysis presented in the current study, such an ‘elbow’
 could be determined by graphing the number of nodes versus the average
 quantised error for each SOM size (Fig.

 maximum.
 However, and despite the ‘elbow’ from Fig.

) suggest more than 15 nodes are required to appropriately describe the
 synoptic influences over Australia.
 Thus a finding by the elbow method that 15 nodes were ‘enough’ to properly
 represent the data was questionable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From initial inspection it was found that a SOM with 48 nodes was much too
 cumbersome to visualise, while a SOM with three nodes was clearly not represent
ative of the variation in synoptic patterns over the last 21 years.
 To determine which of the SOM sizes from the intermediate range of possible
 sizes to employ, an index was proposed.
 The current study asserts that an index that takes into account the number
 of nodes used as well as the average quantised error of each SOM size can
 easily be formulated and implemented by Eq.

 there is a clearly defined continuum of synoptic classifications that range
 from low-pressure intrusions on the left hand side to high pressure intrusions
 on the right hand side.
 The features of the whole domain SOM from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 are in accordance with other studies using the SOM technique with MSLP;

 Transitional phases between episodes of high and low pressure dominance
 are also visible in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:6x5-SOM-space"

\end_inset

, while the ‘traditional’ west-to-east cycle between successive high pressure
 systems is possible if one traces out the SOM perimeter in a clockwise
 fashion.
 The continental SOM (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:6x5-SOM-space-Cont"

\end_inset

) also displays one corner of the SOM space occupied by higher pressure,
 consistent with the subtropical ridge, with the opposite corner dominated
 by lower pressure.
 In the case of the continental SOM
\change_inserted -1458100629 1424665135
,
\change_unchanged
 the SOM nodes that represent the low pressure systems to the south are
 not readily discernible.
 However, it is still clear that the general characteristics of the Australian
 region (like that seen in the whole domain version) are captured in the
 continental version.

For regions that exhibit large seasonality in meteorological conditions
 it might make more sense to conduct the training of the SOM with seasonally
 partitioned data (consequently also one SOM for each season).
 For the Australian region there are indeed some previous studies in which
 the seasonal partitioning is undertaken (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Alexander2010"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Huva2014"

\end_inset

).
 In such studies the SOM is used to study characteristics of the MSLP field,
 and related fields, solely from that season.
 Indeed the southern regions of Australia exhibit seasonality in pressure
 such that certain phenomena (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Gallant-SE-Aus-Teleconnetions"

\end_inset

) occur more commonly in winter as opposed to summer, and vice versa.
 However, what was found in this thesis was little difference in the resulting
 SOM when the data was partitioned into seasons.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 illustrates this relative insensitivity to season by using the same domain
 and time period from the previous regional example (Fig.

 What is seen in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The features seen in Fig.

 are also similar to the previous studies of the Australian region using

).
 Unfortunately though the use of just the wintertime data has not made a
 drastic difference to the level of low pressure intrusion into the domain.
 Instead the wintertime SOM contains just the more northerly centred high
 pressure systems, along with the transition states (ridging high pressure)
 at latitude ~35-40ºS and cold fronts with a more upright structure (nodes
 12, 15-16 and 19-24).
 It is suggested that the time period used (21 years) is sufficiently long
 enough to smoothen the influence of even predominantly winter-only synoptic
 weather types (for instance, cut-off lows).
 It is therefore a reasonable expectation for the wintertime SOM to struggle
 capturing the fast moving and intense low pressure systems that the annual
 SOM also has no closely resembling node for (cut-off and east coast lows).

The intention with this thesis is to study the year-round influential synoptic
 weather types for RE production over Australia.
 The infrastructure needed to capture the RE output analysed in this thesis
 would also be subject to the full annual array of weather types and not
 available to be moved with the seasons.
 In this instance splitting the SOM typing into seasons would make less
 sense.
 It is also overwhelmingly more common in the literature to conduct the
 training of the SOM for the Australian region with all available data (

In order to map the SOM nodes back onto the original data-set a program
 from the SOM_PAK described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Kohonen1995"

\end_inset

 was employed.
 The program called “visual” from the SOM_PAK was used to analyse the time
 steps from original data-set and to assign each time step with a matching
 SOM node (the BMU).
 The SOM node with the smallest Euclidean distance was chosen as the node
 that ‘matched’ each time step and thus the data-set of 30,680 time steps
 was reduced to a time series of just 30 SOM nodes, or synoptic classes.
 However, given the smooth nature of the SOM and the SOM’s ability to span
 the data-space, there were no time steps in the ERA-Interim reanalysis
 that had an exactly matching BMU.
 Thus it was necessary to implement a method for determining whether each
 of the 30,680 BMUs were indeed an accurate match.
 The process of checking the BMUs also ensured that the purpose of the current
 study---to determine the synoptic influences on wind and solar output---was
 not undermined by falsely assigning SOM nodes to conditions from the original
 data-set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the SOM nodes are artificial and there is no direct knowledge
 of the state of the atmosphere corresponding to each node’s pressure distributi
on, any process for checking the matching of SOM nodes back onto the original
 data-set needs to be a function of pressure only.
 However, it was not immediately apparent as to what criteria or criterion
 should be used as an investigation of this sort appears not to have been
 undertaken before with SOMs.

It is, of course, possible to set an upper limit on the quantised error
 or even other measures like the spatial correlation---thus disregarding
 those matches that exceed the upper limit.
 But without the direct knowledge of the state of the atmosphere suggested
 by each SOM node, the cut-off point for considering whether or not the
 pressure distribution from a BMU is not accurate enough is potentially
 fraught with subjectivity

(RMSE) of southern hemisphere surface pressure in the ERA-Interim reanalysis
 is approximately 1.75hPa in the early 1990’s (not shown).
 Assuming a similar error in MSLP (which is derived using the surface pressure,
 average virtual temperature and constants) and considering the equation
 for RMSE in pressure, it was possible to equate the RMSE using observations
 (Eq.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for keeping BMUs.
 Noting the existence of the Euclidean distance term in the numerator of
 Eq.

 and using the value of 1.75hPA for RMSE

, it was argued that any BMU with a Euclidean distance (quantised error)
 less than 61.4hPa was within the error of the ERA-Interim reanalysis and
 thus should be kept.
 The quantised error value of 61.4hPa was thus a minimum criterion to be
 used.
 However, only three of the BMUs for the Austral domain had a quantised
 error below 61.4hPa and thus nearly all BMUs were outside the error of the
 ERA-Interim reanalysis.

With nearly all BMUs having a quantised error larger than the error of the
 ERA-Interim reanalysis, an analysis of the maximum discrepancy (largest
 single grid-point error) across the domain for each BMU and its respective
 time-step was conducted in order to help determine how many BMUs to discount
 as ‘matches’.
 The analysis of the maximum discrepancy
\change_inserted -1458100629 1424137888
 (single grid-point errors)
\change_unchanged
 for all whole domain BMUs revealed a mean maximum discrepancy of 16.9hPa---the
 smallest maximum discrepancy was 5hPa and the largest maximum discrepancy
 was 52.1hPa.
 As per the distribution in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

b, the histogram of maximum discrepancies for the whole domain was also
 quite positively skewed with the mode at 9hPa but the mean and median at
 16.9hPa and 16.1hPa, respectively (not shown).
 It was then thought that a relatively easy way to identify BMUs that had
 pressure distributions too different from their matched time step was to
 eliminate the BMUs with a maximum discrepancy greater than or equal to
 20hPa; 20hPa was chosen as the cut-off value because it represented a balance
 between keeping as many matches as possible (to aid later statistical analyses)
 and not keeping matches that had very obvious MSLP differences.
 Choosing a cut-off criterion that was based on analysing single grid-point
 errors also gave some insight into the spatial distribution of errors,
 which is not possible using the quantised error measurement due to the
 aggregation of error.
 This initial filtering of the BMUs left 22,962 matches out of a total 30,680
 for the whole domain, and left 30,108 matches for the continental domain.

 in the highest 5% (the

`
\change_deleted -1458100629 1424665494

worst' 5%).
 The amount of BMUs left after this second filtering was 21,814 for the
 whole domain and 28,602 for the continental domain.
 Obvious, already, was the fact that the continental domain was far out-performi
ng the whole domain SOM in terms of the number of matches that were surviving
 the filtering.
 The continental domain SOM had many more BMU whose pressure distributions
 closely matched their SOM node (mostly due to the limited domain that contained
 less low pressure intrusions), thus also enhancing later statistical analysis
 involving the occurrence of SOM nodes.

As the second filtering criterion relies upon the quantised error measurement,
 which aggregates the error of the domain, it was then decided that a final
 criterion be utilised to ensure that the remaining BMUs were accurate enough
 with respect to the entire domain.
 The final filtering criterion involved calculating the number of grid-points
 from the BMU seen in Figs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 and

 that were more than 4hPa different from their respective MSLP map from
 ERA-Interim (585 grid-points in the whole domain and 206 grid points in
 the continental domain).
 The BMUs from the remaining 21,814/28,602 matches that had more than 585/206
 grid points with an error greater than 4hPa were then eliminated.
 This final criterion was used as a method for checking the characteristics
 of the domain missed by the quantised error measurement and left a total
 of 21,300 matches for the whole domain and 28,572 matches for the continental
 domain.

To determine the occurrence of the BMUs through time, the remaining BMUs
 were compared with the original set of 30,680 and a BMU from the original
 30,680 that was eliminated through filtering was given a missing value.
 The 21 years of BMUs was then reduced to a time series of filtered BMUs
 and missing values.
 To give an indication of how fragmented the time series of BMUs becomes
 after filtering, a histogram of the number of consecutive time-steps without
 a BMU is presented (Fig.

a shows that although there were some prolonged moments of missing data,
 which extend for more than a few days at a time, the majority (78%) of
 consecutive time-steps without a matching BMU had a period less than a
 day for the whole domain.
 The continental domain, with many more BMUs surviving filtering, did much
 better in this respect with 98% of periods with consecutive missing time
 steps having a length of less than a day.
 The maximum period without data was 12 days in length for the whole domain
 (1800UTC on June 24 1990 up to and including 1200UTC July 6 1990) but as
 can be seen from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SOM-Consec-Zeros-Aft-Filt"

\end_inset

 occurrences of missing data that last more than two days are quite rare
 for both SOMs.
 There was therefore no expectation that statistical testing on monthly,
 seasonally or yearly time-scales would be adversely affected by the missing
 data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, given the ability for the SOM technique to, for the most part,
 partition the MSLP data into easily classifiable synoptic regimes, it does
 appear peculiar that there should exist a 12-day period in which none of
 the SOM nodes from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 were able to describe the pressure distributions that occurred.
 The pressure patterns during the 12 day period in winter of 1990 without
 SOM representation therefore deserve further investigation.

 The position of the high pressure centre in Fig.

 is not considered to be a common location for blocking to occur; blocking
 is more common south-east of the continents in the southern hemisphere
 (

 In fact, had the blocking high occurred in one of the more common locations
 for blocking in the Australian region SOM nodes six or 16 may have been
 suitable as BMUs.
 There are some of the SOM nodes from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 that have high pressure centres resembling that of the blocking high in
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 However, none of the SOM nodes from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:6x5-SOM-space"

\end_inset

 have a high pressure centre that is deep enough or far enough south to
 match the blocking high that occurred during 12B90.
 The associated low pressure centres in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:MSLP-12day-SOM-Failure"

\end_inset

 are also quite intense on some of the days of 12B90 and these types of
 cyclones are commonly filtered out due to the comparatively smooth nature
 of the SOM nodes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact the high pressure centre was almost completely stationary for 12
 days during 12B90 also appears to be abnormal when compared to previous
 research for the southern hemisphere (see

 Analysis by

 suggests that blocking normally lasts around five-seven days when considering
 the domain of the Indian Ocean (roughly 30º-130ºE and south of 30ºS), which
 indicates that blocking in almost the same position for 12 days---like
 that in Fig.

a Perth was anomalously dry and cool during 12B90.
 Using the period of 1961-1990 the average daily rainfall for Perth during

 2.4mm was recorded during 12B90.
 The blocking of cold fronts and rain bearing systems from reaching Perth,
 which is evident from Fig.

 show that the more commonly occurring whole domain SOM nodes were those
 that involved high pressure systems located in either the Bight or south
 of Perth.
 Similarly, the most commonly occurring continental SOM nodes were nodes
 28 and 16, which both involve higher pressures to the south.
 Least common were the SOM nodes that involved low pressure intrusions south
 of Victoria or South Australia (both whole and continental domains), although
 this statistic was easily explained given the fast-moving nature of low
 pressure systems in comparison to high pressure systems (

).
 A more important result was the fact that the SOM technique, in this case,
 was able to identify the seasonality of the Australian region.

 the SOM nodes that occur in summer do not occur in winter, but the difference
 between spring and autumn is less defined.
 The summer nodes generally involve high pressure systems and transitions
 between successive highs to the south of the continent (centred ~ 40ºS).
 Conversely, the winter nodes are those that involve deeper high pressure
 systems than in summer and high pressure systems that are centred more
 over the Australian continent (~30-35ºS).
 Importantly, the implied summer-only and winter-only nodes from Fig.

One of the key differences between the SOM technique and other statistical
 techniques (e.g.
 clustering) involves the SOM’s ability to span the data-space.
 Because each SOM node is closely related to its surrounding nodes there
 is an expectation that transition maps should reveal the temporal evolution
 of synoptic events across the region.
 For instance, one might expect that the west-east progression of synoptic
 weather systems in the mid-latitudes be easily determined from such a plot
 of SOM node transitions.
 However, in the current study such clearly defined transitions were not
 possible (Fig.

a) and it was thought this could have been because the SOM used was too
 large and therefore containing too many intermediate synoptic states.

But more likely, the temporal resolution of the data used was responsible
 for the lack of clear transitions in Fig.

a.
 The use of six-hourly MSLP data in the current study has most likely led
 to less linear paths being traced out across the SOM space, thus leading
 to a less consistently unidirectional transition plot (which is evident
 in the high percentage of no transitions seen in Fig.

b).
 Analysis of MSLP data at 12-hourly or daily intervals, like that in

, could have led to transition plots with a more clearly defined cycle of
 high-low pressure systems.

Despite the limitations of the SOM technique, which are similar to the problems
 encountered with most data synthesis techniques, a SOM of the MSLP in the
 Australian region was able to identify commonly occurring and previously
 identified MSLP pressure patterns, or synoptic regimes (whole domain).
 Using the MSLP field, even though it may not have an immediately obvious
 connection to the wind and solar fields, for categorising the weather into
 regimes was an important process towards identifying commonly co-occurring
 wind and solar conditions.
 Converting the continuous time series of ERA-Interim weather conditions
 into a time series of 30 SOM nodes will allow for an analysis of the wind
 and solar conditions under each SOM node.
 Removal of the ocean MSLP data was also undertaken and an alternative continent
al SOM presented.
 The continental analysis, despite the limited domain, was able to produce
 a set of SOM nodes that contained features consistent with the Australian
 region, while at the same time achieved a much more continuous representation
 of the ERA-Interim data (93% of time-steps had a BMU).
 Importantly, the removal of ocean grid-points rids the domain of a large
 source of error (for instance, the transient low pressure centre seen in
 Fig.

b).
 With a vastly more complete representation of the data from ERA-interim
 by the continental SOM a more comprehensive analysis of the concurrent
 wind and solar conditions associated with each SOM node is possible.
