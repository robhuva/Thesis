abstract = {A high-quality daily dataset of in situ mean sea level pressure was collated for Australia for the period from 1907 to 2006. This dataset was used to assess changes in daily synoptic pressure patterns over Australia in winter using the method of self-organizing maps (SOMs). Twenty patterns derived from the in situ pressure observations were mapped to patterns derived from ERA-40 data to create daily synoptic pressure fields for the past century. Changes in the frequencies of these patterns were analyzed. The patterns that have been decreasing in frequency were generally those most strongly linked to variations in the southern annular mode (SAM) index, while patterns that have increased in frequency were more strongly correlated with variations in the positive phase of El Nino-Southern Oscillation. In general, there has been a reduction in the rain-bearing systems affecting southern Australia since the beginning of the twentieth century. Over the past century. reductions in the frequencies of synoptic patterns with a marked trough to the south of the country were shown to be linked to significant reductions in severe storms in southeast Australia and decreases in rainfall at four major Australian cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth. Of these, Perth showed the most sustained decline in both the mean and extremes of rainfall linked to changes in the large-scale weather systems affecting Australia over the past century. The results suggest a century-long decline in the frequency of low pressure systems reaching southern Australia. consistent with the southward movement of Southern Hemisphere storm tracks. While most of these trends were not significant, associated changes in rainfall and storminess appear to have had significant impacts in the region.},

abstract = {Wind is the world's fastest growing electric energy source. Because it is intermittent, though, wind is not used to supply baseload electric power today. Interconnecting wind farms through the transmission grid is a simple and effective way of reducing deliverable wind power swings caused by wind intermittency. As more farms are interconnected in an array, wind speed correlation among sites decreases and so does the probability that all sites experience the same wind regime at the same time. The array consequently behaves more and more similarly to a single farm with steady wind speed and thus steady deliverable wind power. In this study, benefits of interconnecting wind farms were evaluated for 19 sites, located in the midwestern United States, with annual average wind speeds at 80 m above ground, the hub height of modern wind turbines, greater than 6.9 ms(-1) (class 3 or greater). It was found that an average of 33\% and a maximum of 47\% of yearly averaged wind power from interconnected farms can be used as reliable, baseload electric power. Equally significant, interconnecting multiple wind farms to a common point and then connecting that point to a far-away city can allow the long-distance portion of transmission capacity to be reduced, for example, by 20\% with only a 1.6\% loss of energy. Although most parameters, such as intermittency, improved less than linearly as the number of interconnected sites increased, no saturation of the benefits was found. Thus, the benefits of interconnection continue to increase with more and more interconnected sites.},

abstract = {The goal of this study is to quantify the world's wind power potential for the first time from data. Wind speeds are calculated at 80 m, the hub height of modern, 77-m diameter, 1500 kW turbines. Since relatively few observations are available at 80 m, the Least Square extrapolation technique is utilized and revised here to obtain estimates of wind speeds at 80 m given observed wind speeds at 10 m ( widely available) and a network of sounding stations. Tower data from the Kennedy Space Center ( Florida) were used to validate the results. Globally, similar to 13\% of all reporting stations experience annual mean wind speeds >= 6.9 m/s at 80 m ( i.e., wind power class 3 or greater) and can therefore be considered suitable for low-cost wind power generation. This estimate is believed to be conservative. Of all continents, North America has the largest number of stations in class >= 3 ( 453), and Antarctica has the largest percent ( 60\%). Areas with great potential are found in northern Europe along the North Sea, the southern tip of the South American continent, the island of Tasmania in Australia, the Great Lakes region, and the northeastern and northwestern coasts of North America. The global average 10-m wind speed over the ocean from measurements is 6.64 m/s ( class 6); that over land is 3.28 m/s ( class 1). The calculated 80-m values are 8.60 m/s ( class 6) and 4.54 m/s ( class 1) over ocean and land, respectively. Over land, daytime 80-m wind speed averages obtained from soundings ( 4.96 m/s) are slightly larger than nighttime ones ( 4.85 m/s); nighttime wind speeds increase, on average, above daytime speeds above 120 m. Assuming that statistics generated from all stations analyzed here are representative of the global distribution of winds, global wind power generated at locations with mean annual wind speeds >= 6.9 m/s at 80 m is found to be similar to 72 TW ( similar to 54,000 Mtoe) for the year 2000. Even if only similar to 20\% of this power could be captured, it could satisfy 100\% of the world's energy demand for all purposes ( 6995 - 10177 Mtoe) and over seven times the world's electricity needs ( 1.6 - 1.8 TW). Several practical barriers need to be overcome to fully realize this potential.},

abstract = {The characteristic space-time scales of surface solar radiation fields measured by the Ill-instrument MESONET in Oklahoma are estimated after removal of the diurnal cycle. These estimates of "within-day" variability are used to deduce the representativeness of surface solar radiation measurements made at the central ARM measurement site as a function of rime-averaging interval. Nomograms of the relation between point measurements and area averages are given for different space-time-averaging intervals. Examples from the nomograms show, for instance, that under conditions of low mean radiation (cloudy days), the central site point measurements are representative of a spatial area the size of a T42 GCM grid box (280 km x 280 km) if one uses hourly averages and is willing to accept a correlation of 0.45 between area average and point measurement. The point data represent a 60 km x 60 km region at a 0.90 correlation level if a 5-min time average is used. The characteristic timescale for the within-day radiation variability was roughly 60 min. Estimates of scale lengths for days when the mean background radiation conditions are high are also given in the nomographs.},

We illustrate two deficiencies of Dunn's index which make it overly sensitive to noisy clusters and propose several generalizations of it that are not as brittle to outliers in the clusters. Our numerical examples show that the standard measure of interset distance (the minimum distance between points in a pair of sets) is the worst (least reliable) measure upon which to base cluster validation indexes when the clusters are expected to form volumetric clouds. Experimental results also suggest that intercluster separation plays a more important role in cluster validation than cluster diameter. Our simulations show that while Dunn's original index has operational flaws, the concept it embodies provides a rich paradigm for validation of partitions that have cloud-like clusters. Five of our generalized Dunn's indexes provide the best validation results for the simulations presented.},

abstract = {Over recent years there has been an increasing deployment of renewable energy generation technologies, particularly large-scale wind farms. As wind farm deployment increases, it is vital to gain a good understanding of how the energy produced is affected by climate variations, over a wide range of time-scales, from short (hours to weeks) to long (months to decades) periods. By relating wind speed at specific sites in the UK to a large-scale climate pattern (the North Atlantic Oscillation or "NAO"), the power generated by a modelled wind turbine under three different NAO states is calculated. It was found that the wind conditions under these NAO states may yield a difference in the mean wind power output of up to 10\%. A simple model is used to demonstrate that forecasts of future NAO states can potentially be used to improve month-ahead statistical forecasts of monthly-mean wind power generation. The results confirm that the NAO has a significant impact on the hourly-, daily- and monthly-mean power output distributions from the turbine with important implications for (a) the use of meteorological data (e.g. their relationship to large-scale climate patterns) in wind farm site assessment and, (b) the utilisation of seasonal-to-decadal climate forecasts to estimate future wind farm power output. This suggests that further research into the links between large-scale climate variability and wind power generation is both necessary and valuable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Because of the pressing need for maintaining a healthy environment with reasonable costs, China is moving toward the trend for generating electricity from renewable resources. Both solar energy and wind power have received a tremendous attention from private associations, political groups, and electric power companies to generate power on a large scale. A drawback is their unpredictable nature and dependence on weather. Fortunately, the problems can be partially tackled by using the strengths of one source to overcome the weakness of the other. Especially, a large fraction of the solar resource is available at times of peak electrical load. However, the complexity of using two different resources together makes the hybrid solar-wind generation systems more difficult to analyze. Accordingly, this paper first briefly introduces the solar-wind generation system and next develops its critical success criteria. Then, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process associated with benefits, opportunities, costs and risks, is proposed to help select a suitable solar-wind power generation project. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Satellite observations suggest that the thermal radiation emitted by Earth to space increased by more than 5 watts per square meter, while reflected sunlight decreased by less than 2 watts per square meter, in the tropics over the period 1985-2000, with most of the increase occurring after 1990. By analyzing temporal changes in the frequency of occurrence of emitted thermal and reflected solar fluxes, the effects of El Nino-Southern Oscillation are minimized, and an independent longer-time-scale variation of the radiation budget is identified. Similar analyses of upper tropospheric humidity, cloud amount, surface air temperature, and vertical velocity confirm that these flux changes are associated with a decadal-time-scale strengthening of the tropical Hadley and Walker circulations. Equatorial convective regions have intensified in upward motion and moistened, while both the equatorial and subtropical subsidence regions have become drier and less cloudy.},

abstract = {Global surface pressure data from 1976 to 1997 from over 7500 land stations and the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set have been analyzed using harmonic and zonal harmonic methods. It is found that the diurnal pressure oscillation (S-1) is comparable to the semidiurnal pressure oscillation (S-2) in magnitude over much of the globe except for the low-latitude open oceans, where S-2 is about twice as strong as S-1. Over many land areas, such as the western United States, the Tibetan Plateau, and eastern Africa, S-1 is even stronger than S-2. This is in contrast to the conventional notion that S-2 predominates over much of the globe. The highest amplitudes (similar to 1.3 mb) of S-1 are found over northern South America and eastern Africa close to the equator. Here S-1 is also strong (similar to 1.1 mb) over high terrain such as the Rockies and the Tibetan Plateau. The largest amplitudes of S-2 (similar to 1.0-1.3 mb) are in the Tropics over South America, the eastern and western Pacific. and the Indian Ocean. Here S-1 peaks around 0600-0800 LST at low latitudes and around 1000-1200 LST over most of midlatitudes. while S-2 peaks around 1000 and 2200 LST over low- and midlatitudes. Here S-1 is much stronger over the land than over the ocean and its amplitude distribution is strongly influenced by landmasses, while the land-sea differences of S-2 are small. The spatial variations of S-1 correlate significantly with spatial variations in the diurnal temperature range at the surface, suggesting that sensible heating from the ground is a major forcing for S-1. Although S-2 is much more homogeneous zonally than S-1, there are considerable zonal variations in the amplitude of S-2 which cannot be explained by zonal variations in ozone and water vapor. Other forcings such as those through clouds' reflection and absorption of solar radiation and latent hearing in convective precipitation are needed to explain the observed regional and zonal variations in S-2. The migrating rides S-1 and S-2 predominate over other zonal wave components. However, the nonmigrating tides are substantially stronger than previously reported. The amplitudes of both the migrating and nonmigrating tides decrease rapidly poleward with a slower pace at middle and high latitudes.},

The ERA-Interim project was conducted in part to prepare for a new atmospheric reanalysis to replace ERA-40, which will extend back to the early part of the twentieth century. This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF. Copyright (C) 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

ECMWF reanalysis is the product of many years of outstanding scientific research and development by a large number of individuals. Human as well as technical resources for computing, data services, and user support at ECMWF are excellent and greatly appreciated. Interest and feedback from users of reanalysis data are instrumental to improve the quality of our products. International collaborations with data providers and reanalysis producers have been invaluable to our work. Preparation and production of ERA-Interim has been supported by staff secondments from the NCAS, the JMA, and the KMA. Work at the University of Leeds on the evaluation of the stratospheric circulation produced by ERA-Interim was partly funded by the NERC and by the European Commission via the GEOMON project.

abstract = {This paper reviews the present status of wind power in Australia, the barriers to its further development, and the policies needed for overcoming those barriers. Unlike bioenergy or solar electricity, wind power does not need significant funding for R, D and D in Australia, but rather needs market/industry development policies. The major barrier is the political power of the coal and nuclear industries and NIMBY groups, which have disseminated exaggerated and misleading claims about the environmental impacts and alleged technological limitations of wind power, fostering opposition to wind power by the Federal Government. This paper examines critically one of the main claims, the fallacy that wind power, as a so‐called ‘intermittent’ source, cannot be used to substitute for base‐load power from coal. Continued expansion of the wind industry in Australia would need an extension of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target, reinforced by the implementation of a carbon tax or emission permits with cap and trade.

If the data are Gaussian distributed and not serially correlated, one can use the results of classical statistics to estimate the significance. While some techniques can handle non-Gaussian distributions, few methods are available for data with nonzero autocorrelation (i.e., serially correlated). In this paper, a nonparametric method is suggested to estimate the statistical significance of a computed correlation coefficient when serial correlation is a concern. This method compares favorably with conventional-methods.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the history, the present status and possible future developments of photovoltaic (PV) materials for terrestrial applications. After a brief history and introduction of the photovoltaic effect theoretical requirements for the optimal performance of materials for pn-junction solar cells are discussed. Most important are efficiency, long-term stability and, not to be neglected, lowest possible cost. Today the market is dominated by crystalline silicon in its multicrystalline and monocrystalline form. The physical and technical limitations of this material are discussed. Although crystalline silicon is not the optimal material from a solid state physics point of view it dominates the market and will continue to do this for the next 5-10 years. Because of its importance a considerable part of this review deals with materials aspects of crystalline silicon. For reasons of cost only multicrystalline silicon and monocrystalline Czochralski (Cz) crystals are used in practical cells. Light induced instability in this Cz-material has recently been investigated and ways to eliminate this effect have been devised. For future large scale production of crystalline silicon solar cells development of a special solar grade silicon appears necessary. Ribbon growth is a possibility to avoid the costly sawing process. A very vivid R\&D area is thin-film crystalline silicon (about 5-30 pm active layer thickness) which would avoid the crystal growing and sawing processes. The problems arising for this material are: assuring adequate light absorption, assuring good crystal quality and purity of the films, and finding a substrate that fulfills all requirements. Three approaches have emerged: high-temperature, low-temperature and transfer technique. Genuine thin-film materials are characterized by a direct band structure which gives them very high light absorption. Therefore, these materials have a thickness of only one micron or less. The oldest such material is amorphous silicon which is the second most important material today. It is mainly used in consumer products but is on the verge to also penetrate the power market. Other strong contenders are chalcogenides like copper indium diselenide (CIS) and cadmium telluride. The interest has expanded from CuInSe2, to CuGaSe2, CuInS2 and their multinary alloys Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)(2). The two deposition techniques are either separate deposition of the components followed by annealing on one hand or coevaporation. Laboratory efficiencies for small area devices are approaching 19\% and large area modules have reached 12\%. Pilot production of CIS-modules has started in the US and Germany. Cadmium telluride solar cells also offer great promise. They have only slightly lower efficiency and are also at the start of production. In the future other materials and concepts can be expected to come into play. Some of these are: dye sensitized cells, organic solar cells and various concentrating systems including III/V-tandem cells. Theoretical materials that have not yet been realized are Auger generation material and intermediate metallic band material. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Climatological averages of surface radiation budget parameters, namely, the shortwave and longwave surface radiative fluxes, have been derived for each month of the year on a global scale. These climatological averages were derived from an 8-yr (96 month) time series of monthly average fluxes. The monthly averages were computed using fast radiation parameterizations and satellite data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project and the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment. Results are presented as time series of hemispheric and global averages and as geographical distributions and time-latitude cross sections of climatological averages. The spatial/temporal variabilities of the results were found to be clearly related to the corresponding variabilities of meteorological and other inputs to the parameterizations. Numerous comparisons of the present results were made with available surface measurements for the purpose of validation. In most cases, the differences were found to be within the uncertainties of the measurements. In some cases, where they were large, the differences were attributable to identifiable deficiencies in the meteorological inputs and/or the surface measurements. However, large differences remained unexplained in a few cases. Anomalies of shortwave and longwave surface fluxes during the 1986/87 El Nino-Southern Oscillation episode show a strong relationship with corresponding top-of-atmosphere anomalies derived from an independent data source. Comparisons with results from several general circulation models showed large differences, but, in most cases, these were attributable to well-recognized deficiencies in model simulations. Global annual average downward and net shortwave fluxes were found to be about 185 and 161 W m(-2), respectively. These values are 10-20 W m(-2) lower than those obtained from the general circulation models, bur they are in good agreement with other satellite-derived estimates. Global annual average downward and net longwave fluxes were found to be about 348 and -48 W m(-2), respectively, which are about 10-15 W m(-2) higher than corresponding values from general circulation models. Atmospheric shortwave absorption derived from the present results is 10-15 W m(-2) larger than from the general circulation models, but it is in good agreement with another estimate based on satellite data.},

abstract = {The monthly mean shortwave ( SW) radiation budget at the Earth's surface (SRB) was computed on 2.5-degree longitude-latitude resolution for the 17-year period from 1984 to 2000, using a radiative transfer model accounting for the key physical parameters that determine the surface SRB, and long-term climatological data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP-D2). The model input data were supplemented by data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) and European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Global Reanalysis projects, and other global data bases such as TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and Global Aerosol Data Set ( GADS). The model surface radiative fluxes were validated against surface measurements from 22 stations of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) covering the years 1992 - 2000, and from 700 stations of the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA), covering the period 1984 - 2000. The model is in good agreement with BSRN and GEBA, with a negative bias of 14 and 6.5W m(-2), respectively. The model is able to reproduce interesting features of the seasonal and geographical variation of the surface SW fluxes at global scale. Based on the 17-year average model results, the global mean SW downward surface radiation (DSR) is equal to 171.6W m(-2), whereas the net downward ( or absorbed) surface SW radiation is equal to 149.4W m(-2), values that correspond to 50.2 and 43.7\% of the incoming SW radiation at the top of the Earth's atmosphere. These values involve a long-term surface albedo equal to 12.9\%. Significant increasing trends in DSR and net DSR fluxes were found, equal to 4.1 and 3.7W m(-2), respectively, over the 1984 - 2000 period ( equivalent to 2.4 and 2.2W m(-2) per decade), indicating an increasing surface solar radiative heating. This surface SW radiative heating is primarily attributed to clouds, especially low-level, and secondarily to other parameters such as total precipitable water. The surface solar heating occurs mainly in the period starting from the early 1990s, in contrast to decreasing trend in DSR through the late 1980s. The computed global mean DSR and net DSR flux anomalies were found to range within +/- 8 and +/- 6W m(-2), respectively, with signals from El Nino and La Nina events, and the Pinatubo eruption, whereas significant positive anomalies have occurred in the period 1992 - 2000.},

abstract = {Self organizing maps (SOMs) are used to locate archetypal points that describe the multi-dimensional distribution function of a gridded sea level pressure data set for the northeast United States. These points-nodes on the SOM-identify the primary features of the synoptic-scale circulation over the region. In effect, the nodes represent a non-linear distribution of overlapping, non-discreet, circulation types. The circulation patterns are readily visualized in a 2-dimensional array (the SOM) that places similar types adjacent to one another and very different types far apart in the SOM space. The SOM is used to describe synoptic circulation changes over time, and to relate the circulation to January station precipitation data (for State College, Pennsylvania) in the center of the domain. The paper focuses on the methodology; however, the analysis suggests that circulation systems that promote precipitation have decreased over the last 40 yr-although January precipitation at State College has actually increased. Further analysis with the SOM indicates that this is due to a change in precipitation characteristics of the synoptic-scale circulation features, rather than to their frequency of occurrence.},

abstract = {In Ontario (Canada), the integration of renewable power is a priority policy goal. Since 2004, the circumstances under which the integration of renewable power is evaluated have changed due to successive changes in price as well as concerns that its over-production may add to grid congestion. This research investigates the value of increasing complementarity (both proximate and geographically dispersed) of wind and solar resources as a means by which electricity planners and researchers might advance electricity sustainability in Ontario. More specifically, this paper asks the following questions: 1) Does the combination of solar and wind resources in selected locations in Ontario serve to 'smooth out' power production, i.e., decrease instances of both high and low values, as compared to either resource producing individually? 2) Can this 'smoothness' be further improved by dispersing these resources geographically amongst locations? and 3) Does increasing the number of locations with solar and wind resources further 'smooth out' power production? Three years (2003-2005) of synchronous, hourly measurements of solar irradiance and wind speeds from Environment Canada's Canadian Weather Energy and Engineering Data Sets (CWEEDS) are used to derive dimensionless indices for four locations in Ontario (Toronto, Wiarton, Sault Ste. Marie and Ottawa). These indices are used to develop three transparent and accessible methods of analysis: (1) graphical representation; (2) percentile ranking; and (3) using a theoretical maximum as a proxy for capacity. The article concludes that the combination of solar and wind within locations and amongst two locations improves 'smoothness' in power production, as compared to when each resource is produced on its own; moreover, it is further improved once more than two resources and two locations are combined. However, there is neither further benefit, nor drawback, associated with the geographic dispersion of complementarity between solar in one location and wind in another, when compared to both resources in one location.

@article{Hope2006,
abstract = {A self-organising map is used to classify the winter circulation affecting southwest Western Australia (SWWA) into 20 different synoptic types. The changes in the frequency of these types and their links to observed rainfall are analysed to further understand the significant, prolonged, rainfall drop observed in this region since 1975. The temporal variability of the different synoptic types link well with the observed rainfall changes. The frequency of the troughs associated with wet conditions across SWWA has declined markedly since 1975 while the frequency of the synoptic types with high pressure over the continent, associated with dry conditions, has increased. Combining the frequency of the synoptic systems with the amount of observed rainfall allows a quantitative analysis of the rainfall decline. The decreased frequency of the troughs associated with very wet conditions accounts for half of the decline. Reductions in the amount of rainfall precipitating from each system also contribute to the decline. Large-scale circulation changes, including increases in the mean sea-level pressure and a decrease in the general baroclinicity of the region have been associated with the rainfall decline. These changes are suggested to be linked to increasing levels of greenhouse gases. Due to the strong link between the number of trough types and the rainfall over SWWA, the shifts in the frequency of these synoptic types could be used as a tool to assess simulated rainfall changes, particularly into the future.},

abstract = {Over the Southern Ocean the dominant modes of the atmospheric field are known as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) or Antarctic Oscillation, and the Pacific South American (PSA) pattern. Statistical analysis of sea surface wind (SSW) from satellite observation revealed two leading modes of SAM-like and PSA patterns. In the high latitudes, the SAM-like pattern of the SSW had a large amplitude over the Bellingshausen Basin and Australian-Antarctic Basin, with opposite phase between the two basins. On the intraseasonal time scale, large-scale sea surface height (SSH) also had notable variability, showing a basin-scale anti-phase mode over the two basins. To explain the response of oceanic variations to these atmospheric modes, we analyzed the relationship between the dominant modes of wind stress and large-scale SSH on the intraseasonal time scale. The SAM-like pattern of wind stress was correlated with the SSH variation over the two basins. The SSH basin mode was most simply explained by a simple barotropic response to the SAM-like mode of wind stress, with the curl of opposite phase between the two basins. We conclude that the zonal asymmetry of the wind field of the SAM plays an important role in driving the antiphase SSH basin modes.},

The distribution of cyclones through the hemisphere was found to be dominated by a permanent high latitude core coincident with the circumpolar trough. During the winter and intermediate seasons, two mid latitude branches are evident in the cyclone density originating in the Tasman Sea and South American sectors, both spiraling poleward and merging with the circumpolar core in the Southern Oceans. Systems were observed to move in an east-south-east direction, away from their location of formation, exhibiting peak speeds of migration in the mid latitudes. Little seasonality was evident in the density distribution of cyclones through the Southern Oceans, but a considerable amount was found in their central pressure.},

Here we report on a detailed comparison of wind speed and electric power time series recorded at a continental location in Hungary and estimates provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-40 and Interim databases at nearby grid points. The results show that the temporal behavior is adequately represented in reanalysis records with damped magnitudes, as expected. However, characteristic shape differences in the wind speed histograms for turbine measurements and reanalysis hinder a perfect match of statistics. A satisfying agreement of histograms for measured and modeled output powers is achieved by scaling up surface wind speeds to have the same long time average value as for the turbine records. The presented calibration permits us to provide wind power estimates for large geographic areas, where the wind field is similarly coherent as around the test site.

abstract = {Mean monthly wind speed at 70 m above ground level is investigated for 11 sites in Minnesota for the period 1995 - 2003. Wind speeds at these sites show significant spatial and temporal coherence, with prolonged periods of above- and below-normal values that can persist for as long as 12 months. Monthly variation in wind speed primarily is determined by the north - south pressure gradient, which captures between 22\% and 47\% of the variability (depending on the site). Regression on wind speed residuals (pressure gradient effects removed) shows that an additional 6\% - 15\% of the variation can be related to the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Ni (n) over tildeo-3.4 sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Wind speeds showed little correspondence with variation in the Pacific - North American (PNA) circulation index. The effect of the strong El Ni (n) over tildeo of 1997/98 on the wind speed time series was investigated by recomputing the regression equations with this period excluded. The north - south pressure gradient remains the primary determinant of mean monthly 70-m wind speeds, but with 1997/98 removed the influence of the AO increases at nearly all stations while the importance of the Ni (n) over tildeo-3.4 SSTs generally decreases. Relationships with the PNA remain small. These results suggest that long-term patterns of low-frequency wind speed (and thus wind power) variability can be estimated using large-scale circulation features as represented by large-scale climatic datasets and by climate-change models.},

Four points are noted over regions of higher terrain. The three major components have enhanced amplitude; the diurnal component has earlier phasing; the semi-diurnal component has later phasing; and the ter-diurnal component has later phasing in summer and earlier phasing in winter. The diurnal amplitude peak occurs in spring over northern and eastern Australia, in summer and winter along the northwestern coastal region, and in summer over the western coastal region and interior Australia. In the extreme southern coastal region, no significant seasonal diurnal amplitude peaks can be found among the smaller diurnal amplitudes. In general, earliest diurnal phasing occurs in autumn over most of the continent, except in the extreme south where it occurs in spring. The semi-diurnal component has early spring and early autumn amplitude peaks of similar intensity, as well as late spring and late autumn phase peaks of similar value. The ter-diurnal component reverses phase from summer to winter, and has summer and winter amplitude peaks, with the winter peak being higher. Evolution of the mean daily pressure deviation pattern is included as an attempt to explain diurnal circulations.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the accuracy of several models for estimating daily solar radiation (Q) across Australia. Data from 39 sites were taken from MetAccess. The sites were grouped into four climatic zones. Coefficients of nine models, including two newly developed formulae, were fitted for the 39 sites. Correlation coefficients (R-2) between estimated Q and measured Q and root mean squared error (RMSE) associated with the estimates were calculated. It was concluded that models which expressed rainfall as a binary quantity (1 for rainfall > 0; 0 for rainfall = 0) performed better than those using amount of rainfall (precipitation in mm). The best performed models, one using temperature data only, one using rainfall data only and one using rainfall and temperature were further evaluated. A newly developed model that included temperatures (minimum and maximum) and rain-day information proved the best method. Using the coefficients for estimates of Q at the same sites, averaged R-2 was 0.68, 0.74 and 0.79 and RMSE was 3.24, 3.05 and 2.89 MJ m(-2), for the model using rainfall only, temperature only and both rainfall and temperature, respectively. When Q was estimated using the coefficients from other sites, estimation of Q within eastern and southern zones were more reliable than in northern and central zones. In general, the model using both temperature and rainfall was the best model for either estimated Q for the site where coefficients of the model were developed at the site or imported from other sites. However, in some tropical coastal sites of Australia, such as Broome and Darwin, estimates of Q based on rainfall only can be more reliable when the coefficients were imported from other sites. It was concluded that radiation within a similar climatic region could be well estimated with no local recording, regardless of distance between sites. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This article presents the results of analyses of large-scale integration of wind power, photo voltaic (PV) and wave power into a Danish reference energy system. The possibility of integrating Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the electricity supply is expressed in terms of the ability to avoid excess electricity production. The different sources are analysed in the range of an electricity production from 0 to 100\% of the electricity demand. The excess production is found from detailed energy system analyses on the computer model EnergyPLAN. The analyses have taken into account that certain ancillary services are needed in order to secure the electricity supply system. The idea is to benefit from the different patterns in the fluctuations of different renewable sources. And the purpose is to identify optimal mixtures from a technical point of view. The optimal mixture seems to be when onshore wind power produces approximately 50\% of the total electricity production from RES. Meanwhile, the mixture between PV and wave power seems to depend on the total amount of electricity production from RES. When the total RES input is below 20\% of demand, PV should cover 40\% and wave power only 10\%. When the total input is above 80\% of demand, PV should cover 20\% and wave power 30\%. Meanwhile the combination of different sources is alone far from a solution to large-scale integration of fluctuating resources. This measure is to be seen in combination with other measures such as investment in flexible energy supply and demand systems and the integration of the transport sector. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Near-surface wind speeds (u) measured by terrestrial anemometers show declines (a 'stilling') at a range of mid-latitude sites, but two gridded u datasets (a NCEP/NCAR reanalysis output and a surface-pressure-based u model) have not reproduced the stilling observed at Australian stations. We developed Australia-wide 0.01 degrees resolution daily u grids by interpolating measurements from an expanded anemometer network for 1975-2006. These new grids represented the magnitude and spatial-variability of observed u trends, whereas grids from reanalysis systems (NCEP/NCAR, NCEP/DOE and ERA40) essentially did not, even when minimising the sea-breeze impact. For these new grids, the Australian-averaged u trend for 1975-2006 was -0.009 m s(-1) a(-1) (agreeing with earlier site-based studies) with stilling over 88\% of the land-surface. This new dataset can be used in numerous environmental applications, including benchmarking general circulation models to improve the representation of key parameters that govern u estimation. The methodology implemented here can be applied globally. Citation: McVicar, T. R., T. G. Van Niel, L. T. Li, M. L. Roderick, D. P. Rayner, L. Ricciardulli, and R. J.

abstract = {This work presents an updated climatology of blocking episodes for the Southern Hemisphere between 1960 and 2000, based on data from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. Five contiguous areas of blocking activity are considered; Southeastern Pacific, Southwestern Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Oceania. The impact of the three most important areas of onset blocking episodes (Southeastern Pacific, Atlantic and Oceania) upon the climate of the adjacent continental areas (South America and Australia) was evaluated. Composites of the meteorological variables (temperature and precipitation) were obtained for periods of diagnosed blockings. The impact of the blocking episodes over the climate of South America and Australia is highlighted whenever anomaly fields of temperature and precipitation are significant at the 5\% and 10\% levels, respectively. Impacts of Southeastern Pacific and Atlantic blockings are observed on the temperature field over several regions of South America. Significantly higher (lower) temperatures than climatology occur in southern Brazil, northern Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, and lower (higher) than climatology in the extreme south of South America for the Southeastern Pacific (Atlantic) blocking episodes. Precipitation over South America is also affected by the Southeastern Pacific and Atlantic blockings in different ways. The Southeastern Pacific blocking has higher impact on precipitation in summer (dry conditions in northeast Brazil) and spring (wet conditions in central and southern Brazil), while the Atlantic blocking affects precipitation in autumn and winter (wet conditions in parts of central and southern Brazil). The blocking cases over Oceania affect southeastern Australia with normal to higher than climatological precipitation and with negative temperature anomalies in that region. Finally we provide a detailed analysis of a South Atlantic blocking episode, which occurred between the 4th and the 8th of June 1997. This event shows clearly the split of the jet stream into two branches (subtropical and polar) surrounding the anticyclonic sector, and satellite imagery revealed the presence of transient systems in the periphery of the blocking anticyclone responsible for high values of precipitation in the southeastern sector of South America.

abstract = {An assessment is made of the ability of the singular value decomposition (SYD) technique to recover the relationship between two variables x and y from a time series of their observations. It is shown that SVD is rigorously successful only in the special cases when either (i) the transformation linking x and y is orthogonal or (ii) the covariance matrix of either x or y is the identity matrix. The behavior of the method when theSE conditions are not met is also studied in a simple two-dimensional case. That this caveat can be relevant in a meteorological context is demonstrated by performing an SVD analysis of a time series of global upper-tropospheric streamfunction and vorticity fields. Although these fields are linked by the two-dimensional Laplacian operator on the sphere, it is shown that the pairs of singular patterns resulting from the SVD analysis are not so related. The problem is apparent even for the first SVD pair and generally becomes worse for succeeding pairs These results suggest that any physical interpretation of SVD pairs may be unjustified.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal distribution of the downward solar radiation (DSR) at the Earth's surface, which is a key parameter for the Earth-atmosphere climate system, is studied on a global scale by applying the multivariate statistical method of factor analysis (FA) on mean monthly DSR values for the period 1984-2000 for winter and summer. DSR fluxes have been computed with a physical deterministic radiation transfer model, which uses satellite and reanalysis climatological input data. FA objectively groups grid points with common temporal variability of solar radiation, identifying areas with characteristic solar radiation variability and revealing teleconnection patterns. The globally distributed DSR exhibits strong variability and can be represented by about 30 factors (sub-areas) explaining approximately 85\% of the total variance. The main factors are located in the tropical Pacific (El Nino Southern Oscillation), the northern Pacific (Aleutian low), desert areas (Africa, Middle East, and Australia), and oceanic areas (storm track zone around 60 S). Furthermore, some of these areas are teleconnected indicating common DSR variability in remote places of the Earth. The primary physical parameter for the co-variability of surface solar radiation is found to be cloud cover. The time series of the factor scores (solar radiation) exhibit features associated with natural climatic phenomena (e. g. NAO, ENSO), thus revealing that DSR might be considered as an indirect indicator for these phenomena. On the other hand, DSR determines these phenomena through its effects on major climate parameters such as surface temperature or evaporation, thus playing a key role in their formation and explanation. Finally, our analysis revealed some statistically significant trends of solar radiation, for example, a reduction in the northern Pacific and an increase in tropical and subtropical regions, which are important for global dimming/brightening and associated surface warming of the Earth.

abstract = {Transition mechanisms characterizing changes from hurricanes to midlatitude cyclones and vice-versa (extratropical and tropical transition) have become a topic of increasing interest, partially because of their association with recent unusual storms that have developed in different ocean basins of both hemispheres. The aim of this work is to discuss some recent cases of transition and highly unusual hurricane developments and to address some of their wider implications for climate science. Frequently those dramatic cyclones are responsible for severe weather, potentially causing significant damage to property and infrastructure. An additional manifestation discussed here is their association with cold surges, a topic that has been very little explored in the literature. In the Southern Hemisphere, the first South Atlantic hurricane, Catarina, developed in March 2004 under very unusual large-scale conditions. That exceptional cyclone is viewed as a case of tropical transition facilitated by a well-developed blocking structure. A new index for monitoring tropical transition in the subtropical South Atlantic is discussed. This "South Atlantic index" is used to show that the unusual flow during and prior to Catarina's genesis can be attributed to tropical/extratropical interaction mechanisms. The "Donald Duck" case in Australia and Vince in the North Atlantic have also been examined and shown to belong to a category of hybrid-transitioning systems that will achieve at least partial tropical transition. While clearly more research is needed on the topic of transition, as we gain further insight, it is becoming increasingly apparent that features of large-scale circulation do play a fundamental role. A complex interaction between an extratropical transition case and an extreme summer cold surge affecting southeastern Australia is discussed as an example of wider climate implications.},

abstract = {Given the recent increasing public focus on climate change issues, there is a need for robust, sustainable and climate friendly power transmission and distribution systems that are intelligent, reliable, and green. Current power systems create environmental impacts as well as contributing to global warming due to their utilization of fossil fuels, especially coal, as carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere. In contrast to fossil fuels, renewable energy is starting to be used as the panacea for solving climate change or global warming problems. This paper describes a feasibility study undertaken to invest gate the potentialities of renewable energy including the prospective locations in Australia for renewable energy generation, in particular solar and wind energy. Initially, a hybrid model has been developed to investigate the prospects of wind energy for typical Australian region considering production cost, cost of energy, emission production and contribution from renewable energy using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER), a computer model developed by the USA's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This model also explores suitable places around Australia for wind energy generation using statistical analysis. Subsequently, the usefulness of solar energy in the Australian context and suitable locations for solar energy generation are also investigated using a similar hybrid model. Finally, the model has been developed to investigate the prospects of renewable energy in particular wind and solar energy including specific locations in Australia that would be suitable for both wind and solar energy generation. From simulation analysis it is clearly observed that Australia has enormous potentialities for substantially increased use of renewable energy; a large penetration of renewable energy sources into the national power system would reduce CO(2) emissions significantly, contributing to the reduction of global warming.

abstract = {Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are a relative newcomer to synoptic climatology; the method itself has only been utilized in the field for around a decade. In this article, we review the major developments and climatological applications of SOMs in the literature. The SOM can be used in synoptic climatological analysis in a manner similar to most other clustering methods. However, as the results from a SOM are generally represented by a two-dimensional array of cluster types that 'self-organize', the synoptic categories in the array effectively represent a continuum of synoptic categorizations, compared with discrete realizations produced through most traditional methods. Thus, a larger number of patterns can be more readily understood, and patterns, as well as transitional nodes between patterns, can be discerned. Perhaps the most intriguing development with SOMs has been the new avenues of visualization; the resultant spatial patterns of any variable can be more readily understood when displayed in a SOM. This improved visualization has led to SOMs becoming an increasingly popular tool in various research with climatological applications from other disciplines as well.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new climatology of Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropical cyclones. This has been compiled by applying a state-of-the-art cyclone tracking scheme to the 6-hourly National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) global reanalyses spanning the period 1958-97. The results show there to be, on average, between 35 and 38 cyclonic systems per analysis (depending on season), with the greatest density [exceeding 6 X 10(-3) cyclones (deg lat)(-2)] found south of 60 degrees S in all seasons and in the Indian and west Pacific Oceans in autumn and winter. For the most part, there is a net creation of cyclones (i.e., cyclogenesis exceeds cyclolysis) north of about 50 degrees S, and a net destruction to the south of this latitude. Having said this, the most active cyclogenesis takes place south of 45 degrees S. The NCEP-NCAR reanalyses indicate that most SH cyclogenesis occurs at very high latitudes, and the axis of the maximum lies on, or to the south of, 60 degrees S. This is in agreement with the deductions of many modern studies of SH cyclone behavior. The region is also host to even greater levels of cyclolytic activity. The authors consider measures of the importance and influence (e.g., for eddy fluxes) of cyclonic systems. It is suggested that the "depth" of a system (the pressure difference between the center and the "edge" of a cyclone) is relatively bias-free and useful measure of a cyclone's status and effect on the circulation. The greatest climatological depths are seen to lie at about 60 degrees S, well to the north of the circumpolar trough and of the region of greatest cyclone density. The mean lifetime of cyclones that last at least 1 day is just over 3 days. Those that are located between 50 degrees and 70 degrees S (at their half-lifetime) endure, on average, almost one day longer than all other systems. The mean track length of winter systems is 2315 km, which reduces to 1946 km in summer. The significance of the work presented here lies in a number of factors. First, the climatology has been derived from 40 yr of analysis, a period longer than any considered heretofore. Further, the (re)analyses used can be regarded as one of the best representations of the global atmosphere. The availability of these analyses at 6-hourly intervals means that the uncertainties with tracking of cyclones are greatly diminished. Finally, it has been compiled using one of the most sophisticated and reliable automatic cyclone finding and tracking schemes. This climatology of SH extratropical cyclones is arguably the most accurate and representative set yet assembled.},

abstract = {An automated procedure for locating and tracking high pressure centers is applied to 10 years of twice-daily ECMWF analyses during 1980-89 to survey the behavior of anticyclones in the Southern Hemisphere. Anticyclones are concentrated in the 25 degrees-45 degrees S band, with preferred regions consistent with previous studies except in the New Zealand (NZ)-South Pacific sector, where a double occurrence maximum noted in earlier studies was only weakly evident. Marked interannual variability was found in this region, with the poleward branch of maximum occurrence south of 50 degrees S present in only 3 out of 10 years. Mean central pressure maximized about 10 degrees south of the time-averaged ridge, with highest values in winter. Anticyclones poleward of 50 degrees S involve an anomalous breakdown of the westerlies, with mean central pressures there 20-30 hPa higher than climatology. Highs tend to form and intensify in western regions of ocean basins and weaken and dissipate in the east of these oceans. Regions southeast of Australia, NZ, South America, and Africa are especially prone to rapid anticyclogenesis. Blocking episodes were objectively identified both from the anticyclone track data as persistent highs having central pressure exceeding the time-averaged mean sea level pressure (MSLP) by more than 20 hPa and as persistent positive MSLP anomalies. Weaker or more mobile blocks were found throughout the South Pacific east of NZ, with secondary maxima east of South America and southeast of Africa, as in previous studies. However, more persistent and intense blocks were largely confined to two regions of the South Pacific-south-east of NZ and near 55 degrees S, 110 degrees W, west of South America.},

abstract = {This paper compares and evaluates fourteen contemporary forecasts of global supply of conventional oil and provides some observations on their relative plausibility. Despite the wide range of modelling approaches used and multiplicity of assumptions made, it is shown that forecasts can be usefully compared along two dimensions, namely: shape of future production profile and assumed or implied ultimately recoverable resource of conventional oil. Other differences between forecasts are either secondary or are components of these two parameters. The paper shows how large differences in the assumed size of the resource make relatively little difference to the timing of a global peak in conventional oil production. It also examines the impact of rates of discovery, reserves growth and depletion on the forecast date of peak and shows how forecasts that delay this peak until beyond 2030 rest on assumptions that are at best optimistic and at worst implausible.

In this study, we present a methodology, based on properties of common colour schemes, to plot two variables in a single colour map by using a two-dimensional colour legend for both sequential and diverging data. This is especially suited for climate data as the spatial distribution of the relation between different variables is often as important as the distribution of variables individually. Two example applications are given to illustrate the use of the method: one that shows the global distribution of climate based on observed temperature and relative humidity, and the other showing the distribution of recent changes in observed temperature and precipitation over Europe.

abstract = {The leading modes of variability of the extratropical circulation in both hemispheres are characterized by deep, zonally symmetric or "annular" structures, with geopotential height perturbations of opposing signs in the polar cap region and in the surrounding zonal ring centered near 45 degrees latitude. The structure and dynamics of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode have been extensively documented, whereas the existence of a Northern Hemisphere (NH) mode, herein referred to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), has only recently been recognized. Like the SH mode, the AO can be defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function of the sea level pressure field or of the zonally symmetric geopotential height or zonal wind fields. In this paper the; structure and seasonality of the NH and SH modes are compared based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis and supplementary datasets. The structures of the NH and SH annular modes are shown to be remarkably similar, not only in the zonally averaged geopotential height and zonal wind fields, but in the mean meridional circulations as well. Both exist year-round in the troposphere, but they amplify with height upward into the stratosphere during those seasons in which the strength of the zonal flow is conducive to strong planetary wave-mean how interaction: midwinter in the NH and late spring in the SH. During these "active seasons," the annular modes modulate the strength of the Lagrangian mean circulation in the lower stratosphere, total column ozone and tropopause height over mid- and high latitudes, and the strength of the trade winds of their respective hemispheres. The NH mode also contains an embedded planetary wave signature with expressions in surface air temperature, precipitation, total column ozone, and tropopause height. It is argued that the horizontal temperature advection by the perturbed zonal-mean zonal wind field in the lower troposphere is instrumental in forcing this pattern. A companion paper documents the striking resemblance between the structure of the annular modes and observed climate trends over the past few decades.},

abstract = {From 1979 to 1989, global European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses of many meteorological variables important in baroclinic storms have been bandpass filtered to highlight fluctuations on 2- to 8-day time scales in order to illuminate the relationships among the variables in baroclinic storm-track regions. Because of the greater zonal symmetry in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) versus the Northern Hemisphere (NH), it is possible to examine these relationships over a zonal sector without being dominated by local effects associated with jet stream entrance and "it regions of the storm tracks. The bandpassed variance of geopotential height is used to define the storm track, and its meridional profile has a pronounced midlatitude maximum in the SH. The locations of the jet stream and the variance maxima of meridional and zonal velocity components, vorticity, vertical motion, specific humidity, and temperature all bear a distinctive relationship to the storm track, but the latitudes of their maxima are displaced from the center of the storm track. Many covariance quantities such as the transient eddy temperature, moisture, vorticity, and vertical and horizontal momentum fluxes also exhibit a strong storm-track signature. The observed relationships among the eddy quantities can generally be understood in terms of geostrophic theory and perturbation analysis applied to baroclinic systems. Storm-track activity is remarkably persistent throughout the year in both location and intensity in the SH. The storm track is farthest poleward in the transition seasons as part of a semiannual cycle, but remains near 50-degrees-S year round, and is strongest in the southern Indian Ocean and weakest in the South Pacific. There is a strong relationship between the storm track and the major tropospheric polar jet stream and its associated lower-level baroclinicity throughout the year, and the distribution of storm-track activity can be accounted for by baroclinic theory. In contrast to the NH, strongest meridional temperature gradients in middle latitudes are found in the summer half-year in the SH. Whereas the NH storm-track activity is much weaker in summer and shifts poleward, the SH activity is as strong as in winter and, if anything, shifts slightly equatorward. The zonal symmetry is greater in summer and meridional profiles are sharper, implying less variability in the storm track both within and between seasons. In winter, high-frequency storm-track activity extends over a broader range of latitudes and continues to be mainly associated with the polar jet stream. The question of the impact of the storm-track eddies on the mean flow is examined using zonal mean and a localized Eliassen-Palm flux. Baroclinic effects from the poleward heat flux dominate in winter and the eddies act to decelerate the upper tropospheric westerlies. Barotropic effects in the upper troposphere, mostly from the meridional momentum flux convergence, help to maintain the mean westerly distribution by accelerating the main polar jet and maintaining the mean split in the flow near New Zealand in both summer and winter and even dominate the baroclinic component in the storm track in summer. Diabatic heating by the eddies may also help maintain the mean flow.},

abstract = {In this paper regional (synoptic) and large-scale climate drivers of rainfall are investigated for Victoria, Australia. A non-linear classification methodology known as self-organizing maps (SOM) is used to identify 20 key regional synoptic patterns, which are shown to capture a range of significant synoptic features known to influence the climate of the region. Rainfall distributions are assigned to each of the 20 patterns for nine rainfall stations located across Victoria, resulting in a clear distinction between wet and dry synoptic types at each station. The influence of large-scale climate modes on the frequency and timing of the regional synoptic patterns is also investigated. This analysis revealed that phase changes in the El Ni\~{n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and/or the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are associated with a shift in the relative frequency of wet and dry synoptic types on an annual to interannual timescale. In addition, the relative frequency of synoptic types is shown to vary on a multi-decadal timescale, associated with changes in the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Importantly, these results highlight the potential to utilise the link between the regional synoptic patterns derived in this study and large-scale climate modes to improve rainfall forecasting for Victoria, both in the short- (i.e. seasonal) and long-term (i.e. decadal/multi-decadal scale). In addition, the regional and large-scale climate drivers identified in this study provide a benchmark by which the performance of Global Climate Models (GCMs) may be assessed.

abstract = {Single field principal component analysis (PCA), direct singular value decomposition (SVD), canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and combined principal component analysis (CPCA) of two fields are applied to a 39-winter dataset consisting of normalized seasonal mean sea surface temperature anomalies over the North Pacific and concurrent 500-mb height anomalies over the same region. The CCA solutions are obtained by linear transformations of the SVD solutions. Spatial patterns and various measures of the variances and covariances explained by the modes derived from the different types of expansions are compared, with emphasis on the relative merits of SVD versus CCA. Results for two different analysis domains (i.e., the Pacific sector versus a full hemispheric domain for the 500-mb height field) are also compared in order to assess the domain dependence of the two techniques. The SVD solution is also compared with the results of 28 Monte Carlo simulations in which the temporal order of the SST grids is randomized and found to be highly significant. As expected, the leading SVD modes explain substantially more of the squared covariance between the two fields than any of the CCA modes, while the paired expansion coefficients of the leading CCA modes are more strongly correlated than any of the SVD modes. The expansion coefficient for the leading SVD mode is almost identical to the leading principal component of the SST field, regardless of whether the 500-mb height field is hemispheric or restricted to the Pacific sector. SST patterns strongly resembling the second and third EOFs are also recovered among the three leading SVD modes. The leading CCA mode in the expansion based on the three leading singular value vectors for the Pacific sector resembles the pattern of anomalies observed in association with ENSO. The other modes more closely resemble the patterns derived from PCA of the 500-mb height field than those for the SVD modes on which they are based. The SVD and CPCA solutions for the first three modes proved to be quite similar. The SVD and CCA solutions based on the hemispheric 500-mb height field are indicative of a coupling between the interannual variability of North Pacific and North Atlantic SST by virtue of their mutual relationship to one of the atmosphere's most prominent planetary wave patterns.},

@article{Watterson2007,
abstract = {Both high-latitude (HLM) and low-latitude modes (LLM) of variability of zonal wind in the Southern Hemisphere have been identified. Through an analysis of simulation for 1871-2200 by the CSIRO Mark 3 climate model, the extent to which these might both be described as "annular modes," based oil their statistical patterns. physical mechanisms. and usefulness in climate study, is assessed. The modes are determined as EOF1 and EOF2 of vertically integrated zonal and monthly mean zonal wind, for 1871-1970. These match well those from ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA) data and also from the earlier Mark 2 model. The mode index time series relate to largely annular patterns of local wind and surface pressure anomalies [with HUM giving the familiar southern annular mode (SAM)]. and other simulated quantities. While modes calculated from 90 degrees sectors are only moderately correlated (mostly in the polar region) for HLM, the link increases with time scale. There is little such relationship for LLM. A momentum equation analysis using daily data confirms that both zonal modes are driven by eddies, but only HLM features a positive eddy-mean flow feedback. Variation in feedback and surface damping through the seasonal cycle relate well to that in index autocorrelation. with the HLM being more persistent in summer. Stratospheric winds feature a long-lived component that tends to lead the FILM. The FILM drives sea surface temperature anomalies that persist for months, and Coupling with the ocean increases variability on longer time scales. The annular variability in the warmer climate of the twenty-second century is barely changed, but the mean climate change in the far south projects strongly on the HLM. The LLM features some statistical annularity and may have Some uses. However, only the HLM can be considered to be a physically based mode-the zonal-wind equivalent to the one southern annular mode.},
