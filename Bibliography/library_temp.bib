abstract = {The optimal sizing of a small autonomous hybrid power system can be a very challenging task, clue to the large number of design settings and the uncertainty in key parameters. This problem belongs to the category of combinatorial optimization, and its solution based on the traditional method of exhaustive enumeration can be proved extremely time-consuming. This paper proposes a binary genetic algorithm in order to solve the optimal sizing problem. Genetic algorithms are popular optimization metaheuristic techniques based on the principles of genetics and natural selection and evolution, and can be applied to discrete or continuous solution space problems. The obtained results prove the performance of the proposed methodology in terms of solution quality and computational time.},

abstract = {The renewable power generation aggregated across Europe exhibits strong seasonal behaviors. Wind power generation is much stronger in winter than in summer. The opposite is true for solar power generation. In a future Europe with a very high share of renewable power generation those two opposite behaviors are able to counterbalance each other to a certain extent to follow the seasonal load curve. The best point of counterbalancing represents the seasonal optimal mix between wind and solar power generation. It leads to a pronounced minimum in required stored energy. For a 100\% renewable Europe the seasonal optimal mix becomes 55\% wind and 45\% solar power generation. For less than 100\% renewable scenarios the fraction of wind power generation increases and that of solar power generation decreases. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents the methodology and results of the overall energy system analysis of a 100\% renewable energy system. The input for the systems is the result of a project of the Danish Association of Engineers, in which 1600 participants during more than 40 seminars discussed and designed a model for the future energy system of Denmark. The energy system analysis methodology includes hour by hour computer simulations leading to the design of flexible energy systems with the ability to balance the electricity supply and demand. The results are detailed system designs and energy balances for two energy target years: year 2050 with 100\% renewable energy from biomass and combinations of wind, wave and solar power; and year 2030 with 50\% renewable energy, emphasising the first important steps on the way. The conclusion is that a 100\% renewable energy supply based on domestic resources is physically possible, and that the first step towards 2030 is feasible to Danish society. However, Denmark will have to consider to which degree the country shall rely mostly on biomass resources, which will involve the reorganisation of the present use of farming areas, or mostly on wind power, which will involve a large share of hydrogen or similar energy carriers leading to certain inefficiencies in the system design. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The goal of this study is to quantify the world's wind power potential for the first time from data. Wind speeds are calculated at 80 m, the hub height of modern, 77-m diameter, 1500 kW turbines. Since relatively few observations are available at 80 m, the Least Square extrapolation technique is utilized and revised here to obtain estimates of wind speeds at 80 m given observed wind speeds at 10 m ( widely available) and a network of sounding stations. Tower data from the Kennedy Space Center ( Florida) were used to validate the results. Globally, similar to 13\% of all reporting stations experience annual mean wind speeds ≥ 6.9 m/s at 80 m ( i.e., wind power class 3 or greater) and can therefore be considered suitable for low-cost wind power generation. This estimate is believed to be conservative. Of all continents, North America has the largest number of stations in class ≥ 3 ( 453), and Antarctica has the largest percent ( 60\%). Areas with great potential are found in northern Europe along the North Sea, the southern tip of the South American continent, the island of Tasmania in Australia, the Great Lakes region, and the northeastern and northwestern coasts of North America. The global average 10-m wind speed over the ocean from measurements is 6.64 m/s ( class 6); that over land is 3.28 m/s ( class 1). The calculated 80-m values are 8.60 m/s ( class 6) and 4.54 m/s ( class 1) over ocean and land, respectively. Over land, daytime 80-m wind speed averages obtained from soundings ( 4.96 m/s) are slightly larger than nighttime ones ( 4.85 m/s); nighttime wind speeds increase, on average, above daytime speeds above 120 m. Assuming that statistics generated from all stations analyzed here are representative of the global distribution of winds, global wind power generated at locations with mean annual wind speeds ≥ 6.9 m/s at 80 m is found to be similar to 72 TW ( similar to 54,000 Mtoe) for the year 2000. Even if only similar to 20\% of this power could be captured, it could satisfy 100\% of the world's energy demand for all purposes ( 6995 - 10177 Mtoe) and over seven times the world's electricity needs ( 1.6 - 1.8 TW). Several practical barriers need to be overcome to fully realize this potential.},

abstract = {In this paper, issues of security of supply, energy spillage control, and peaking options, within a fully renewable electricity system, are addressed. We show that a generation mix comprising 49\% hydro, 23\% wind, 13\% geothermal, 14\% pumped hydro energy storage peaking plant, and 1\% biomass-fuelled generation on an installed capacity basis, was capable of ensuring security of supply over an historic 6-year period, which included the driest hydrological year on record in New Zealand since 1931. Hydro spillage was minimised, or eliminated, by curtailing a proportion of geothermal generation. Wind spillage was substantially reduced by utilising surplus generation for peaking purposes, resulting in up to 99.8\% utilisation of wind energy. Peaking requirements were satisfied using 1550. MW of pumped hydro energy storage generation, with a capacity factor of 0.76\% and an upper reservoir storage equivalent to 8\% of existing hydro storage capacity. It is proposed that alternative peaking options, including biomass-fuelled gas turbines and demand-side measures, should be considered. As a transitional policy, the use of fossil-gas-fuelled gas turbines for peaking would result in a 99.8\% renewable system on an energy basis. Further research into whether a market-based system is capable of delivering such a renewable electricity system is suggested. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

If the data are Gaussian distributed and not serially correlated, one can use the results of classical statistics to estimate the significance. While some techniques can handle non-Gaussian distributions, few methods are available for data with nonzero autocorrelation (i.e., serially correlated). In this paper, a nonparametric method is suggested to estimate the statistical significance of a computed correlation coefficient when serial correlation is a concern. This method compares favorably with conventional-methods.},

abstract = {The New Zealand electricity generation system is dominated by hydro generation at approximately 60\% of installed capacity between 2005 and 2007, augmented with approximately 32\% fossil-fuelled generation, plus minor contributions from geothermal, wind and biomass resources. In order to explore the potential for a 100\% renewable electricity generation system with substantially increased levels of wind penetration, fossil-fuelled electricity production was removed from an historic 3-year data set, and replaced by modelled electricity production from wind, geothermal and additional peaking options. Generation mixes comprising 53-60\% hydro, 22-25\% wind, 12-14\% geothermal, 1\% biomass and 0-12\% additional peaking generation were found to be feasible on an energy and power basis, whilst maintaining net hydro storage. Wind capacity credits ranged from 47\% to 105\% depending upon the incorporation of demand management, and the manner of operation of the hydro system. Wind spillage was minimised, however, a degree of residual spillage was considered to be an inevitable part of incorporating non-dispatchable generation into a stand-alone grid system. Load shifting was shown to have considerable advantages over installation of new peaking plant. Application of the approach applied in this research to countries with different energy resource mixes is discussed, and options for further research are outlined. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A high-quality daily dataset of in situ mean sea level pressure was collated for Australia for the period from 1907 to 2006. This dataset was used to assess changes in daily synoptic pressure patterns over Australia in winter using the method of self-organizing maps (SOMs). Twenty patterns derived from the in situ pressure observations were mapped to patterns derived from ERA-40 data to create daily synoptic pressure fields for the past century. Changes in the frequencies of these patterns were analyzed. The patterns that have been decreasing in frequency were generally those most strongly linked to variations in the southern annular mode (SAM) index, while patterns that have increased in frequency were more strongly correlated with variations in the positive phase of El Nino-Southern Oscillation. In general, there has been a reduction in the rain-bearing systems affecting southern Australia since the beginning of the twentieth century. Over the past century. reductions in the frequencies of synoptic patterns with a marked trough to the south of the country were shown to be linked to significant reductions in severe storms in southeast Australia and decreases in rainfall at four major Australian cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth. Of these, Perth showed the most sustained decline in both the mean and extremes of rainfall linked to changes in the large-scale weather systems affecting Australia over the past century. The results suggest a century-long decline in the frequency of low pressure systems reaching southern Australia. consistent with the southward movement of Southern Hemisphere storm tracks. While most of these trends were not significant, associated changes in rainfall and storminess appear to have had significant impacts in the region.},

We developed Australia-wide 0.01? resolution daily u grids by interpolating measurements from an expanded anemometer network for 1975–2006. These new grids represented the magnitude and spatial- variability of observed u trends, whereas grids from reanalysis systems (NCEP/NCAR, NCEP/DOE and ERA40) essentially did not, even when minimising the sea-breeze impact. For these new grids, the Australian- averaged u trend for 1975–2006 was ?0.009 m s?1 a?1 (agreeing with earlier site-based studies) with stilling over 88\% of the land-surface. This new dataset can be used in numerous environmental applications, including benchmarking general circulation models to improve the representation of key parameters that govern u estimation.

abstract = {Hybrid energy systems are being utilized for supplying electrical energy in urban, rural and remote areas to overcome the intermittence of solar and wind resources. A hybrid renewable energy system incorporates two or more electricity generation options based on renewable energy or fossil fuel unit. The techno-economic analysis of the hybrid system is essential for the efficient utilization of renewable energy resources. Due to multiple generation systems, hybrid system analysis, is quite complex and requires to be analyzed thoroughly. This requires software tools for the design, analysis, optimization, and economic viability of the systems. In this paper, 19 softwares with their main features and current status are presented. The softwares studied are HOMER, Hybrid2, RETScreen, iHOGA, INSEL, TRNSYS, iGRHYSO, HYBRIDS, RAPSIM, SOMES, SOLSTOR, HySim, HybSim, IPSYS, HySys, Dymola/Modelica, ARES, SOLSIM, and HYBRID DESIGNER. The research work related to hybrid systems carried out using these softwares at different locations worldwide is also reviewed. The main objective of the paper is to provide the current status of these softwares to provide basic insight for a researcher to identify and utilize suitable tool for research and development studies of hybrid systems. The capabilities of different softwares are also highlighted. The limitations, availability and areas of further research have also been identified. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Energy is a vital input for social and economic development. As a result of the generalization of agricultural, industrial and domestic activities the demand for energy has increased remarkably, especially in emergent countries. This has meant rapid grower in the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in fuel prices, which are the main driving forces behind efforts to utilize renewable energy sources more effectively, i.e. energy which comes from natural resources and is also naturally replenished. Despite the obvious advantages of renewable energy, it presents important drawbacks, such as the discontinuity of generation, as most renewable energy resources depend on the climate, which is why their use requires complex design, planning and control optimization methods. Fortunately, the continuous advances in computer hardware and software are allowing researchers to deal with these optimization problems using computational resources, as can be seen in the large number of optimization methods that have been applied to the renewable and sustainable energy field. This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in computational optimization methods applied to renewable and sustainable energy, offering a clear vision of the latest research advances in this field. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Reconstructed daily mean sea level pressure patterns of the North Atlantic–European region are classified for the period 1850 to 2003 to explore long-term changes of the atmospheric circulation and its impact on long-term temperature variability in the central European region. Commonly used k-means clustering algorithms resulted in classifications of low quality because of methodological deficiencies leading to local optima by chance for complex datasets. In contrast, a newly implemented clustering scheme combining the concepts of simulated annealing and diversified randomization (SANDRA) is able to reduce substantially the influence of chance in the cluster assignment, leading to partitions that are noticeably nearer to the global optimum and more stable. The differences between conventional cluster analysis and the SANDRA scheme are significant for subsequent analyses of single clusters—in particular, for trend analysis.

abstract = {Highly Integrated Community Energy Systems (ICES) greatly but not solely dependent on combined heat and power (CHP) sources are a viable approach for dealing effectively with the new set of global threats which Mankind is facing, such as Climate Change, Global Warming and Extreme Poverty. ICES are capable of delivering sustainable electricity, heat and cold to small communities and of working as grid-connected or islanded microgrids, adding technical, economical, environmental and social benefits to populations. The impacts of introducing ICES in current distribution networks can be analyzed at different scales due to the wide range of influence exerted not only at the local but also at regional and global levels. For these reasons, there is increased need for appropriate modeling of ICES for the vital purposes of planning and analysis of these systems. An overview on the available bottom-up tools for the optimization planning and analysis of ICES is done in this paper. The survey shows that DER-CAM can be considered an appropriate tool for the purpose of ICES design modeling due to the robust and flexible three-level optimization algorithm, hourly time step and other scale considerations but particularly due to the several successful applications with modeling microgrid systems. Additionally there is research experience on expanding the objective function for environmental concerns and also with EV battery storage interactions. Finally, GAMS DER-CAMs base language, is a widely known package for allowing changes to be made in model specifications simply and safely. In that sense, there is potential in exploring such tool for the design of ICES. Furthermore, it is found that MARKAL/TIMES, also a GAMS/CPLEX based tool, has scale flexibility which enables it for analyzing the long-term deployment of ICES in time. There is opportunity in this field for further work exploring the sustainability-sound modeling for optimal design of ICES and deployment scenario options evaluation, through long-term time horizons consideration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

While the developers have performed verification and validation, there is little information on their relative performance in particular related to their use in ocean modeling. This study focuses on the intercomparison of wind speeds and wave heights from ERA-I and CFSR utilizing the same set of altimetry and buoy observations and error metrics to assess their consistency in time and space. Both products have good spatial homogeneity with consistent levels of errors in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. ERA-I proves to be homogenous through time, while CFSR exhibits an abrupt decrease in the level of errors in the Southern Ocean beginning 1994. ERA-I generally underestimates the wind speed and wave height with lower standard deviations in comparison to observations, but maintains slightly better error metrics. Despite having a small positive bias, CFSR provides a better description of the variability of the observations and improved performance in the upper percentiles associated with extreme events. Overall ERA-I has better homogeneity through time deeming it more reliable for modeling of long-term processes; however caution must be applied with analysis of the upper percentiles. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results show that the temporal behavior is adequately represented in reanalysis records with damped magnitudes, as expected. However, characteristic shape differences in the wind speed histograms for turbine measurements and reanalysis hinder a perfect match of statistics.Asatisfying agreement of histograms for measured and modeled output powers is achieved by scaling up surface wind speeds to have the same long time average value as for the turbine records. The presented calibration permits us to provide wind power estimates for large geographic areas, where the wind field is similarly coherent as around the test site.},

The results in this paper provide the information necessary to identify a suitable energy tool for analysing the integration of renewable energy into various energy-systems under different objectives. It is evident from this paper that there is no energy tool that addresses all issues related to integrating renewable energy, but instead the 'ideal' energy tool is highly dependent on the specific objectives that must be fulfilled. The typical applications for the 37 tools reviewed (from analysing single-building systems to national energy-systems), combined with numerous other factors such as the energy-sectors considered, technologies accounted for, time parameters used, tool availability, and previous studies, will alter the perception of the 'ideal' energy tool.

abstract = {The Eastern Seaboard (ESB) of Australia is a distinct climate entity, with little relationship between rainfall in this area and the major drivers of rainfall elsewhere in Australia such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). One potential cause is the influence of East Coast Lows (ECLs), major coastal weather systems that can produce a significant proportion of rainfall in this region. In this article, a novel approach is used to separate the ECL component of rainfall on the ESB from other sources of rainfall. This method is used to quantify the influence of ECLs on rainfall in this region, with ECLs responsible for 23\% of rainfall in the ESB and 40\% of widespread heavy rain events. While ECLs are particularly important in the southern ESB and during the cool season (May-October) they can occur in any month, particularly in northern areas of the ESB. ECLs are identified as a significant factor in the weakened relationship between ENSO and rainfall in the ESB, particularly in southern parts; however, these are not the only factor, with local topographic effects also likely to play a role.

abstract = {To analyze the challenge of large-scale integration of renewables during the next decades, we present a conceptual power system model that bridges the gap between long term investment allocation and short-term system operation decisions. It integrates dynamic investments in generation, transmission and storage capacities as well as short-term variability and spatial distribution of supply and demand in a single intertemporal optimization framework. Large-scale grid topology, power flow distributions and storage requirements are determined endogenously. Results obtained with a three region model application indicate that adequate and timely investments in transmission and storage capacities are of great importance. Delaying these investments, which are less costly than investments in generation capacities, leads to system-wide indirect effects, such as non-optimal siting of renewable generation capacities, decreasing generation shares of renewables, increasing residual emissions and hence higher overall costs. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Global surface pressure data from 1976 to 1997 from over 7500 land stations and the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set have been analyzed using harmonic and zonal harmonic methods. It is found that the diurnal pressure oscillation (S-1) is comparable to the semidiurnal pressure oscillation (S-2) in magnitude over much of the globe except for the low-latitude open oceans, where S-2 is about twice as strong as S-1. Over many land areas, such as the western United States, the Tibetan Plateau, and eastern Africa, S-1 is even stronger than S-2. This is in contrast to the conventional notion that S-2 predominates over much of the globe. The highest amplitudes (similar to 1.3 mb) of S-1 are found over northern South America and eastern Africa close to the equator. Here S-1 is also strong (similar to 1.1 mb) over high terrain such as the Rockies and the Tibetan Plateau. The largest amplitudes of S-2 (similar to 1.0-1.3 mb) are in the Tropics over South America, the eastern and western Pacific. and the Indian Ocean. Here S-1 peaks around 0600-0800 LST at low latitudes and around 1000-1200 LST over most of midlatitudes. while S-2 peaks around 1000 and 2200 LST over low- and midlatitudes. Here S-1 is much stronger over the land than over the ocean and its amplitude distribution is strongly influenced by landmasses, while the land-sea differences of S-2 are small. The spatial variations of S-1 correlate significantly with spatial variations in the diurnal temperature range at the surface, suggesting that sensible heating from the ground is a major forcing for S-1. Although S-2 is much more homogeneous zonally than S-1, there are considerable zonal variations in the amplitude of S-2 which cannot be explained by zonal variations in ozone and water vapor. Other forcings such as those through clouds' reflection and absorption of solar radiation and latent hearing in convective precipitation are needed to explain the observed regional and zonal variations in S-2. The migrating rides S-1 and S-2 predominate over other zonal wave components. However, the nonmigrating tides are substantially stronger than previously reported. The amplitudes of both the migrating and nonmigrating tides decrease rapidly poleward with a slower pace at middle and high latitudes.},

@article{Simmonds2000,
abstract = {This paper presents a new climatology of Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropical cyclones. This has been compiled by applying a state-of-the-art cyclone tracking scheme to the 6-hourly National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) global reanalyses spanning the period 1958-97. The results show there to be, on average, between 35 and 38 cyclonic systems per analysis (depending on season), with the greatest density [exceeding 6 X 10(-3) cyclones (deg lat)(-2)] found south of 60 degrees S in all seasons and in the Indian and west Pacific Oceans in autumn and winter. For the most part, there is a net creation of cyclones (i.e., cyclogenesis exceeds cyclolysis) north of about 50 degrees S, and a net destruction to the south of this latitude. Having said this, the most active cyclogenesis takes place south of 45 degrees S. The NCEP-NCAR reanalyses indicate that most SH cyclogenesis occurs at very high latitudes, and the axis of the maximum lies on, or to the south of, 60 degrees S. This is in agreement with the deductions of many modern studies of SH cyclone behavior. The region is also host to even greater levels of cyclolytic activity. The authors consider measures of the importance and influence (e.g., for eddy fluxes) of cyclonic systems. It is suggested that the "depth" of a system (the pressure difference between the center and the "edge" of a cyclone) is relatively bias-free and useful measure of a cyclone's status and effect on the circulation. The greatest climatological depths are seen to lie at about 60 degrees S, well to the north of the circumpolar trough and of the region of greatest cyclone density. The mean lifetime of cyclones that last at least 1 day is just over 3 days. Those that are located between 50 degrees and 70 degrees S (at their half-lifetime) endure, on average, almost one day longer than all other systems. The mean track length of winter systems is 2315 km, which reduces to 1946 km in summer. The significance of the work presented here lies in a number of factors. First, the climatology has been derived from 40 yr of analysis, a period longer than any considered heretofore. Further, the (re)analyses used can be regarded as one of the best representations of the global atmosphere. The availability of these analyses at 6-hourly intervals means that the uncertainties with tracking of cyclones are greatly diminished. Finally, it has been compiled using one of the most sophisticated and reliable automatic cyclone finding and tracking schemes. This climatology of SH extratropical cyclones is arguably the most accurate and representative set yet assembled.},

abstract = {The authors analyze the performance of 22 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) global climate models (GCMs) over all of North America and its western subregion using several different evalu- ation metrics. They assess the model skill in simulating climatologies of several climate variables and the skill in simulating the daily synoptic patterns. The evaluation is performed by comparing the model output with the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) over the period 1980–99. One set of metrics, based on root- mean-square errors and variance ratios, compares modeled versus the NARR mean annual cycle and in- terannual variability. Based on these measures the three top performing models are the ECHAM5–Max Planck Institute Ocean Model (MPI-OM), the third climate configuration of the Met Office Unified Model (HadCM3), and the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) Coupled General Cir- culation Model, version 3.1 [CGCM3.1(T47)]. Models that perform well over all North America also perform well over its western subregion. However, the model ranking is sensitive to the choice of climate variable. For another evaluation measure the method of self-organizing maps was applied to classify the characteristic daily patterns of sea level pressure over the region. The evaluation consists of correlating the frequencies of these patterns, as generated in GCMs, with the frequencies in the NARR over the baseline period. Most of the models are successful in simulating the frequencies of daily anomaly patterns from the 20-yr-average daily pattern. However, very few GCMs are able to reproduce the occurrences of characteristic daily weather patterns in theNARRon seasonal basis over the baseline period. In terms of relative performance, the three top performing models are the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) CGCM2.3.2, ECHAM5–MPI-OM, and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate 3.2, high-resolution version [MIROC3.2(hires)]. The model skill in simulating daily synoptic patterns is not strongly linked to the skill in simulating the climatologies of selected variables. Despite the large scatter of model performance across all the metrics, some models consistently rank high [e.g., ECHAM5–MPI-OM and MIROC3.2(medres)]. Likewise, some models consistently rank low [e.g., the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3) and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E-R (GISS-ER)] independently of the evaluation measures, domain size, and climate variable of interest.},

abstract = {Climate change is one of the great challenges of the 21st century. Its most severe impacts may still be avoided if efforts are made to transform current energy systems. Renewable energy sources have a large potential to displace emissions of greenhouse gases from the combustion of fossil fuels and thereby to mitigate climate change. If implemented properly, renewable energy sources can contribute to social and economic development, to energy access, to a secure and sustainable energy supply, and to a reduction of negative impacts of energy provision on the environment and human health. This Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) impartially assesses the scientifi c literature on the potential role of renewable energy in the mitigation of climate change for policymakers, the private sector, academic researchers and civil society. It covers six renewable energy sources – bioenergy, direct solar energy, geothermal energy, hydropower, ocean energy and wind energy – as well as their integration into present and future energy systems. It considers the environmental and social consequences associated with the deployment of these technologies, and presents strategies to overcome technical as well as non-technical obstacles to their application and diffusion. The authors also compare the levelized cost of energy from renewable energy sources to recent non-renewable energy costs. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide the world with a clear scientifi c view on the current state of knowledge on climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the present status of wind power in Australia, the barriers to its further development, and the policies needed for overcoming those barriers. Unlike bioenergy or solar electricity, wind power does not need significant funding for R, D and D in Australia, but rather needs market/industry development policies. The major barrier is the political power of the coal and nuclear industries and NIMBY groups, which have disseminated exaggerated and misleading claims about the environmental impacts and alleged technological limitations of wind power, fostering opposition to wind power by the Federal Government. This paper examines critically one of the main claims, the fallacy that wind power, as a so‐called ‘intermittent’ source, cannot be used to substitute for base‐load power from coal. Continued expansion of the wind industry in Australia would need an extension of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target, reinforced by the implementation of a carbon tax or emission permits with cap and trade.

abstract = {In this paper regional (synoptic) and large-scale climate drivers of rainfall are investigated for Victoria, Australia. A non-linear classification methodology known as self-organizing maps (SOM) is used to identify 20 key regional synoptic patterns, which are shown to capture a range of significant synoptic features known to influence the climate of the region. Rainfall distributions are assigned to each of the 20 patterns for nine rainfall stations located across Victoria, resulting in a clear distinction between wet and dry synoptic types at each station. The influence of large-scale climate modes on the frequency and timing of the regional synoptic patterns is also investigated. This analysis revealed that phase changes in the El Ni\~{n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and/or the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are associated with a shift in the relative frequency of wet and dry synoptic types on an annual to interannual timescale. In addition, the relative frequency of synoptic types is shown to vary on a multi-decadal timescale, associated with changes in the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Importantly, these results highlight the potential to utilise the link between the regional synoptic patterns derived in this study and large-scale climate modes to improve rainfall forecasting for Victoria, both in the short- (i.e. seasonal) and long-term (i.e. decadal/multi-decadal scale). In addition, the regional and large-scale climate drivers identified in this study provide a benchmark by which the performance of Global Climate Models (GCMs) may be assessed.

abstract = {Over the Southern Ocean the dominant modes of the atmospheric field are known as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) or Antarctic Oscillation, and the Pacific South American (PSA) pattern. Statistical analysis of sea surface wind (SSW) from satellite observation revealed two leading modes of SAM-like and PSA patterns. In the high latitudes, the SAM-like pattern of the SSW had a large amplitude over the Bellingshausen Basin and Australian-Antarctic Basin, with opposite phase between the two basins. On the intraseasonal time scale, large-scale sea surface height (SSH) also had notable variability, showing a basin-scale anti-phase mode over the two basins. To explain the response of oceanic variations to these atmospheric modes, we analyzed the relationship between the dominant modes of wind stress and large-scale SSH on the intraseasonal time scale. The SAM-like pattern of wind stress was correlated with the SSH variation over the two basins. The SSH basin mode was most simply explained by a simple barotropic response to the SAM-like mode of wind stress, with the curl of opposite phase between the two basins. We conclude that the zonal asymmetry of the wind field of the SAM plays an important role in driving the antiphase SSH basin modes.},

abstract = {Zonal-mean or basin-mean analyses often conclude that the midlatitude circulation will undergo a poleward shift with global warming. In this study, the models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project are used to provide a detailed examination of midlatitude circulation change as a function of longitude and season. The two-dimensional vertically integrated momentum budget is used to identify the dominant terms that maintain the anomalous surface wind stress, thereby allowing a distinction between features that are maintained by high-frequency eddies and those that involve changes in the lower-frequency or stationary flow. In the zonal mean, in each season and hemisphere there is a poleward shifting of the midlatitude surface wind stress, primarily maintained by high-frequency transient eddies. This is not necessarily the case locally. In the Southern Hemisphere, for the most part, the interpretation of the response as being a high-frequency eddy-driven poleward shifting of the midlatitude westerlies holds true. The Northern Hemisphere is considerably more complex with only the fall months showing a robust poleward shift of both the Atlantic and Pacific jets. During the winter months the jet in the east Pacific actually shifts equatorward and the Atlantic jet strengthens over Europe. An important role for altered climatological stationary waves in these responses is found. This motivates future work that should focus on zonal asymmetries and stationary wave changes, as well as the changes in high-frequency transients that bring about the poleward shifting of the westerlies in the zonal mean.},

abstract = {This article presents the results of analyses of large-scale integration of wind power, photo voltaic (PV) and wave power into a Danish reference energy system. The possibility of integrating Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the electricity supply is expressed in terms of the ability to avoid excess electricity production. The different sources are analysed in the range of an electricity production from 0 to 100\% of the electricity demand. The excess production is found from detailed energy system analyses on the computer model EnergyPLAN. The analyses have taken into account that certain ancillary services are needed in order to secure the electricity supply system. The idea is to benefit from the different patterns in the fluctuations of different renewable sources. And the purpose is to identify optimal mixtures from a technical point of view. The optimal mixture seems to be when onshore wind power produces approximately 50\% of the total electricity production from RES. Meanwhile, the mixture between PV and wave power seems to depend on the total amount of electricity production from RES. When the total RES input is below 20\% of demand, PV should cover 40\% and wave power only 10\%. When the total input is above 80\% of demand, PV should cover 20\% and wave power 30\%. Meanwhile the combination of different sources is alone far from a solution to large-scale integration of fluctuating resources. This measure is to be seen in combination with other measures such as investment in flexible energy supply and demand systems and the integration of the transport sector. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Single field principal component analysis (PCA), direct singular value decomposition (SVD), canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and combined principal component analysis (CPCA) of two fields are applied to a 39-winter dataset consisting of normalized seasonal mean sea surface temperature anomalies over the North Pacific and concurrent 500-mb height anomalies over the same region. The CCA solutions are obtained by linear transformations of the SVD solutions. Spatial patterns and various measures of the variances and covariances explained by the modes derived from the different types of expansions are compared, with emphasis on the relative merits of SVD versus CCA. Results for two different analysis domains (i.e., the Pacific sector versus a full hemispheric domain for the 500-mb height field) are also compared in order to assess the domain dependence of the two techniques. The SVD solution is also compared with the results of 28 Monte Carlo simulations in which the temporal order of the SST grids is randomized and found to be highly significant. As expected, the leading SVD modes explain substantially more of the squared covariance between the two fields than any of the CCA modes, while the paired expansion coefficients of the leading CCA modes are more strongly correlated than any of the SVD modes. The expansion coefficient for the leading SVD mode is almost identical to the leading principal component of the SST field, regardless of whether the 500-mb height field is hemispheric or restricted to the Pacific sector. SST patterns strongly resembling the second and third EOFs are also recovered among the three leading SVD modes. The leading CCA mode in the expansion based on the three leading singular value vectors for the Pacific sector resembles the pattern of anomalies observed in association with ENSO. The other modes more closely resemble the patterns derived from PCA of the 500-mb height field than those for the SVD modes on which they are based. The SVD and CPCA solutions for the first three modes proved to be quite similar. The SVD and CCA solutions based on the hemispheric 500-mb height field are indicative of a coupling between the interannual variability of North Pacific and North Atlantic SST by virtue of their mutual relationship to one of the atmosphere's most prominent planetary wave patterns.},

abstract = {Those reluctant to endorse a widespread conversion to renewable energy sources in the U.S. frequently argue that the undeniably intermittent nature of solar and wind power make it difficult, if not impossible, to provide reliable power to meet variations in demand without substantial backup generation. Several studies, concentrating on areas with ample sources of both wind and solar power have suggested that a combination of the two, when spread over a sufficiently wide geographic area, could be used to overcome the inherent intermittency of each separately, reducing the need for backup generation. Moreover, since the backup power is required at more or less randomly distributed times, the availability of baseload power, so strongly entrenched in utility circles, becomes more or less irrelevant.},

abstract = {Observed regional rainfall characteristics can be analyzed by examining both the frequency and intensity of different categories of rainfall. A complementary approach is to consider rainfall characteristics associated with regional synoptic regimes. These two approaches are combined here to examine daily rainfall characteristics over the Australian region, providing a target for model simulations. Using gridded daily rainfall data for the period 1997–2007, rainfall at each grid point and averaged over several sites is decomposed into the frequency of rainfall events and the intensity of rainfall associated with each event. Daily sea level pressure is classified using a self-organizing map, and rainfall on corresponding days is assigned to the resulting synoptic regimes. This technique is then used to evaluate rainfall in the new AustralianCommunity Climate and Earth- System Simulator (ACCESS) global climate model and separate the influence of large-scale circulation errors and errors due to the representation of subgrid-scale physical processes. The model exhibits similar biases to many other global climate models, simulating too frequent light rainfall and heavy rainfall of insufficient intensity. These errors are associated with particular synoptic regimes over different sectors of the Australian continent and surrounding oceans. The model simulates only weak convective rainfall over land during the summer monsoon, and heavy rainfall associated with frontal systems over southern Australia is also not simulated. As the model captures the structure and frequency of synoptic patterns, but not the associated rainfall intensity or frequency, it is likely that the source of the rainfall errors lies in model physical parameterizations rather than large-scale dynamics.},

abstract = {Over recent years there has been an increasing deployment of renewable energy generation technologies, particularly large-scale wind farms. As wind farm deployment increases, it is vital to gain a good understanding of how the energy produced is affected by climate variations, over a wide range of time-scales, from short (hours to weeks) to long (months to decades) periods.By relating wind speed at specific sites in the UK to a large-scale climate pattern (the North Atlantic Oscillation or "NAO"), the power generated by a modelled wind turbine under three different NAO states is calculated. It was found that the wind conditions under these NAO states may yield a difference in the mean wind power output of up to 10\%. A simple model is used to demonstrate that forecasts of future NAO states can potentially be used to improve month-ahead statistical forecasts of monthly-mean wind power generation.The results confirm that the NAO has a significant impact on the hourly-, daily- and monthly-mean power output distributions from the turbine with important implications for (a) the use of meteorological data (e.g. their relationship to large-scale climate patterns) in wind farm site assessment and, (b) the utilisation of seasonal-to-decadal climate forecasts to estimate future wind farm power output. This suggests that further research into the links between large-scale climate variability and wind power generation is both necessary and valuable. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Nowadays, modern power networks have to face a number of challenges such as growing electricity demand, aging utility infrastructure and not to forget the environmental impact of the greenhouse gases produced by conventional electric generation. In order to increase renewable energy penetration but without disregarding security and reliability matters during the process, distribution power networks need to evolve to a flexible power network, better known as smart grid, in which distributed intelligence, communication technologies and automated control systems work as the driving factors. Taking into consideration this new frame, intelligent optimization techniques emerge as the only suitable way to optimally design this smart grid. In this paper, a generalized optimization formulation is introduced to determine the optimal location of distributed generators to offer reactive power capability. In order to find a suitable solution to such Reactive Power Management problem, genetic algorithms are applied in those cases where different multiobjective functions are to be considered. A more detailed description of the genetic algorithm evolution process is shown in a microgrid example. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Gupta1999,
abstract = {Climatological averages of surface radiation budget parameters, namely, the shortwave and longwave surface radiative fluxes, have been derived for each month of the year on a global scale. These climatological averages were derived from an 8-yr (96 month) time series of monthly average fluxes. The monthly averages were computed using fast radiation parameterizations and satellite data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project and the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment. Results are presented as time series of hemispheric and global averages and as geographical distributions and time-latitude cross sections of climatological averages. The spatial/temporal variabilities of the results were found to be clearly related to the corresponding variabilities of meteorological and other inputs to the parameterizations. Numerous comparisons of the present results were made with available surface measurements for the purpose of validation. In most cases, the differences were found to be within the uncertainties of the measurements. In some cases, where they were large, the differences were attributable to identifiable deficiencies in the meteorological inputs and/or the surface measurements. However, large differences remained unexplained in a few cases. Anomalies of shortwave and longwave surface fluxes during the 1986/87 El Nino-Southern Oscillation episode show a strong relationship with corresponding top-of-atmosphere anomalies derived from an independent data source. Comparisons with results from several general circulation models showed large differences, but, in most cases, these were attributable to well-recognized deficiencies in model simulations. Global annual average downward and net shortwave fluxes were found to be about 185 and 161 W m(-2), respectively. These values are 10-20 W m(-2) lower than those obtained from the general circulation models, bur they are in good agreement with other satellite-derived estimates. Global annual average downward and net longwave fluxes were found to be about 348 and -48 W m(-2), respectively, which are about 10-15 W m(-2) higher than corresponding values from general circulation models. Atmospheric shortwave absorption derived from the present results is 10-15 W m(-2) larger than from the general circulation models, but it is in good agreement with another estimate based on satellite data.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Self organizing maps (SOMs) are used to locate archetypal points that describe the multi-dimensional distribution function of a gridded sea level pressure data set for the northeast United States. These points�nodes on the SOM�identify the primary features of the synoptic-scale circulation over the region. In effect, the nodes represent a non-linear distribution of overlapping, non-discreet, circulation types. The circulation patterns are readily visualized in a 2-dimensional array (the SOM) that places similar types adjacent to one another and very different types far apart in the SOM space. The SOM is used to describe synoptic circulation changes over time, and to relate the circulation to January station precipitation data (for State College, Pennsylvania) in the center of the domain. The paper focuses on the methodology; however, the analysis suggests that circulation systems that promote precipitation have decreased over the last 40 yr�although January precipitation at State College has actually increased. Further analysis with the SOM indicates that this is due to a change in precipitation characteristics of the synoptic-scale circulation features, rather than to their frequency of occurrence.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of this level of temporal resolution for a model that includes variable residential loads, wind, solar, diesel generator, and batteries. The component models were analyzed individually and as a complete system to develop an understanding of how each is affected by the temporal resolution. With higher resolution, the wind energy output and the fuel consumption of the genset increased. The PV and battery simulations were unaffected by temporal resolution. Agreement between optimization results was found to greatly depend on system configuration. Systems with only diesel for backup were found to increase in cost with higher temporal resolution. Those with battery backup were much less affected by the time step. For systems with both diesel and battery backup, the optimal system costs were fairly close but the optimal component sizes differed. Because of the many factors that affect the results of these systems, it is not yet possible to determine a general recommendation for choosing a time step prior to a simulation. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Our numerical examples show that the standard measure of interset distance (the minimum distance between points in a pair of sets) is the worst (least reliable) measure upon which to base cluster validation indexes when the clusters are expected to form volumetric clouds. Experimental results also suggest that intercluster separation plays a more important role in cluster validation than cluster diameter. Our simulations show that while Dunn's original index has operational flaws, the concept it embodies provides a rich paradigm for validation of partitions that have cloud-like clusters. Five of our generalized Dunn's indexes provide the best validation results for the simulations presented.},

And 2) we seek minimal cost, calculating true cost of electricity without subsidies and with inclusion of external costs. Our model evaluated over 28 billion combinations of renewables and storage, each tested over 35,040 h (four years) of load and weather data. We find that the least cost solutions yield seemingly-excessive generation capacity - at times, almost three times the electricity needed to meet electrical load. This is because diverse renewable generation and the excess capacity together meet electric load with less storage, lowering total system cost. At 2030 technology costs and with excess electricity displacing natural gas, we find that the electric system can be powered 90\%-99.9\% of hours entirely on renewable electricity, at costs comparable to today's - but only if we optimize the mix of generation and storage technologies. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

As expected, the leading SVD modes explain substantially more of the squared covariance between the two fields than any of the CCA modes, while the paired expansion coefficients of the leading CCA modes are more strongly correlated than any of the SVD modes. The expansion coefficient for the leading SVD mode is almost identical to the leading principal component of the SST field, regardless of whether the 500-mb height field is hemispheric or restricted to the Pacific sector. SST patterns strongly resembling the second and third EOFs are also recovered among the three leading SVD modes. The leading CCA mode in the expansion based on the three leading singular value vectors for the Pacific sector resembles the pattern of anomalies observed in association with ENSO. The other modes more closely resemble the patterns derived from PCA of the 500-mb height field than those for the SVD modes on which they are based. The SVD and CPCA solutions for the first three modes proved to be quite similar. The SVD and CCA solutions based on the hemispheric 500-mb height field are indicative of a coupling between the interannual variability of North Pacific and North Atlantic SST by virtue of their mutual relationship to one of the atmosphere's most prominent planetary wave patterns.},

abstract = {An automated procedure for locating and tracking high pressure centers is applied to 10 years of twice-daily ECMWF analyses during 1980-89 to survey the behavior of anticyclones in the Southern Hemisphere. Anticyclones are concentrated in the 25 degrees-45 degrees S band, with preferred regions consistent with previous studies except in the New Zealand (NZ)-South Pacific sector, where a double occurrence maximum noted in earlier studies was only weakly evident. Marked interannual variability was found in this region, with the poleward branch of maximum occurrence south of 50 degrees S present in only 3 out of 10 years. Mean central pressure maximized about 10 degrees south of the time-averaged ridge, with highest values in winter. Anticyclones poleward of 50 degrees S involve an anomalous breakdown of the westerlies, with mean central pressures there 20-30 hPa higher than climatology. Highs tend to form and intensify in western regions of ocean basins and weaken and dissipate in the east of these oceans. Regions southeast of Australia, NZ, South America, and Africa are especially prone to rapid anticyclogenesis. Blocking episodes were objectively identified both from the anticyclone track data as persistent highs having central pressure exceeding the time-averaged mean sea level pressure (MSLP) by more than 20 hPa and as persistent positive MSLP anomalies. Weaker or more mobile blocks were found throughout the South Pacific east of NZ, with secondary maxima east of South America and southeast of Africa, as in previous studies. However, more persistent and intense blocks were largely confined to two regions of the South Pacific-south-east of NZ and near 55 degrees S, 110 degrees W, west of South America.},

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields. We provide evidence for substantial improvements in each of these aspects. We also identify areas where further work is needed and describe opportunities and objectives for future reanalysis projects at ECMWF},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to determine whether the geographic dispersion of solar-photovoltaic panels reduces variability in energy production. Following this, three questions are posed: 1) If geographic dispersion reduces variability, how dispersed should the panels be?; 2) What happens during peak price periods?; and 3) How are these insights affected by consideration of system-wide demand? Using measured and modelled weather data on an hourly basis from 16 locations across Ontario (Canada), hourly energy production figures for 1000kW of solar-photovoltaic panels are generated for 2003, 2004, and 2005. Geographical dispersion of panels across multiple locations (as compared to the deployment of all panels in one location, namely, Toronto, Ontario) leads to, in particular instances, energy production profiles that have lower variability, greater total energy production, and a higher correlation value with the Ontario-wide system. Further research is needed both to isolate particularly-advantageous combinations and to broaden the investigation to consider alternative performance metrics, additional analytical techniques and land-use implications. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {An assessment is made of the ability of the singular value decomposition (SYD) technique to recover the relationship between two variables x and y from a time series of their observations. It is shown that SVD is rigorously successful only in the special cases when either (i) the transformation linking x and y is orthogonal or (ii) the covariance matrix of either x or y is the identity matrix. The behavior of the method when theSE conditions are not met is also studied in a simple two-dimensional case. That this caveat can be relevant in a meteorological context is demonstrated by performing an SVD analysis of a time series of global upper-tropospheric streamfunction and vorticity fields. Although these fields are linked by the two-dimensional Laplacian operator on the sphere, it is shown that the pairs of singular patterns resulting from the SVD analysis are not so related. The problem is apparent even for the first SVD pair and generally becomes worse for succeeding pairs These results suggest that any physical interpretation of SVD pairs may be unjustified.},

abstract = {The main goal of this study is a comparison of two different methods of pattern recognition. The first, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is a method frequently used in climatology. The second, Self Organizing Maps (SOM), is a relatively new and efficient method based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). In order to compare the two methodologies, two teleconnection patterns were chosen, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which mostly affects the climate of Western Europe, and the North Sea-Caspian Pattern (NCP), mainly affecting eastern Mediterranean and the Balkan Peninsula. The teleconnection patterns are studied for winter 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies over the broader Europe area. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the ECHAM5/MPI General Circulation Model (GCM) in representing the two teleconnection patterns for a reference (1971-2000) and a future (2071-2100) period. The evaluation of the reference period is done comparing the simulated data to the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. The future period is studied to examine whether the current dominant circulation patterns change or not during the last 30 years of the 21st century. According to the results, both PCA and SOM methodologies capture the main variability mode over the study area, represented by the NAO pattern, but SOM is capable of capturing even less pronounced patterns, such as the NCP. In the future simulations, the atmospheric circulation during winter seems to be more pronounced with stronger NAO and NCP teleconnection patterns. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Because of the pressing need for maintaining a healthy environment with reasonable costs, China is moving toward the trend for generating electricity from renewable resources. Both solar energy and wind power have received a tremendous attention from private associations, political groups, and electric power companies to generate power on a large scale. A drawback is their unpredictable nature and dependence on weather. Fortunately, the problems can be partially tackled by using the strengths of one source to overcome the weakness of the other. Especially, a large fraction of the solar resource is available at times of peak electrical load. However, the complexity of using two different resources together makes the hybrid solar-wind generation systems more difficult to analyze. Accordingly, this paper first briefly introduces the solar-wind generation system and next develops its critical success criteria. Then, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process associated with benefits, opportunities, costs and risks, is proposed to help select a suitable solar-wind power generation project. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A new high-resolution regional climate change ensemble has been established for Europe within the World Climate Research Program Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) initiative. The first set of simulations with a horizontal resolution of 12.5 km was completed for the new emission scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 with more simulations expected to follow. The aim of this paper is to present this data set to the different communities active in regional climate modelling, impact assessment and adaptation. The EURO-CORDEX ensemble results have been compared to the SRES A1B simulation results achieved within the ENSEMBLES project. The large-scale patterns of changes in mean temperature and precipitation are similar in all three scenarios, but they differ in regional details, which can partly be related to the higher resolution in EURO-CORDEX. The results strengthen those obtained in ENSEMBLES, but need further investigations. The analysis of impact indices shows that for RCP8.5, there is a substantially larger change projected for temperature-based indices than for RCP4.5. The difference is less pronounced for precipitation-based indices. Two effects of the increased resolution can be regarded as an added value of regional climate simulations. Regional climate model simulations provide higher daily precipitation intensities, which are completely missing in the global climate model simulations, and they provide a significantly different climate change of daily precipitation intensities resulting in a smoother shift from weak to moderate and high intensities. © 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {As a part of a program to explore technological options for the transition to a renewable energy future, we present simulations for 100\% renewable energy systems to meet actual hourly electricity demand in the five states and one territory spanned by the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2010. The system is based on commercially available technologies: concentrating solar thermal (CST) power with thermal storage, wind, photovoltaic (PV), existing hydro and biofuelled gas turbines. Hourly solar and wind generation data are derived from satellite observations, weather stations, and actual wind farm outputs. Together CST and PV contribute about half of total annual electrical energy supply. A range of 100\% renewable energy systems for the NEM are found to be technically feasible and meet the NEM reliability standard. The principal challenge is meeting peak demand on winter evenings following overcast days when CST storage is partially charged and sometimes wind speeds are low. The model handles these circumstances by combinations of an increased number of gas turbines and reductions in winter peak demand. There is no need for conventional base-load power plants. The important parameter is the reliability of the whole supply-demand system, not the reliability of particular types of power plants. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a conceptual framework for comparing methods that isolate important coupled modes of variability between time series of two fields. Four specific methods are compared: principal component analysis with the fields combined (CPCA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and a variant of CCA proposed by Barnett and Preisendorfer (BP), principal component analysis of one single field followed by correlation of its component amplitudes with the second field (SFPCA), and singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix between the two fields (SVD). SVD and CPCA are easier to implement than BP, and do not involve user-chosen parameters. All methods are applied to a simple but geophysically relevant model system and their ability to detect a coupled signal is compared as parameters such as the number of points in each field, the number of samples in the time domain, and the signal-to-noise ratio are varied. In datasets involving geophysical fields, the number of sampling times may not be much larger than the number of observing locations or grid points for each field. In a model system with these characteristics, CPCA usually extracted the coupled pattern somewhat more accurately than SVD, BP, and SFPCA, since the patterns it yielded exhibit smaller sampling variability; SVD and BP gave quite similar results; and CCA was uncompetitive due to a high sampling variability unless the coupled signal was highly localized. The coupled modes derived from CPCA and SFPCA exhibit an undesirable mean bias toward the leading EOFs of the individual fields; in fact, for small signal-to-noise ratios these methods may identify a coupled signal that is similar to a dominant EOF of one of the fields but is completely orthogonal to the true coupled signal within that field. For longer time series, or in situations where the coupled signal does not resemble the EOFs of the individual fields, these biases can make SVD and BP substantially superior to CPCA.},

abstract = {Future power systems are likely to include large amounts of variable power generation such as solar and wind power. As a variable output has to be balanced by the power system's reserves, it is important to study the time variability, coincidence, and correlations between power sources. The effect of output smoothing from dispersion of wind power plants is well established, but there is a need to study more renewables in combination. This study analyses large-scale solar and wind power in a future scenario for Sweden, using climatic data covering eight years with an hourly resolution. It is shown that solar and wind power are negatively correlated on all time scales, from hourly to annual, but that the correlation is strongest for monthly totals. Combining solar and wind power reduces total variations in terms of standard deviation, but hour-to-hour variability is always higher with a larger share of solar power.},

abstract = {In recent decades, Southern Hemisphere midlatitude regions such as southern Africa, southeastern Australia, and southern Chile have experienced a reduction in austral autumn precipitation; the cause of which is poorly understood. This study focuses on the ability of global climate models that form part of the Coupled ModelIntercomparison Project phase 5 to simulate these trends, their relationship with extratropical and subtropical processes, and implications for future precipitation changes. Models underestimate both the historical autumn poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zone and the positive southern annular mode (SAM) trend. The multimodel ensemble (MME) is also unable to capture the spatial pattern of observed precipitation trends across semiarid midlatitude regions. However, in temperate regions that are located farther poleward such as southern Chile, the MME simulates observed precipitation declines. The MME shows a strong consensus in twenty-first-century declines in autumn precipitation across southern Chile in both the medium–low and high representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and across southern Africa in the high RCP scenario, but little change across southeastern Australia. Projecting a strong positive SAMtrend and continued subtropical dry-zone expansion, the models converge on largeSAMand dry-zone- expansion-induced precipitation declines across southern midlatitudes. In these regions, the strength of future precipitation trends is proportional to the strength of modeled trends in these phenomena, suggesting that unabated greenhouse gas–induced climate change will have a large impact on austral autumn precipitation in such midlatitude regions.},

abstract = {Transition mechanisms characterizing changes from hurricanes to midlatitude cyclones and vice-versa (extratropical and tropical transition) have become a topic of increasing interest, partially because of their association with recent unusual storms that have developed in different ocean basins of both hemispheres. The aim of this work is to discuss some recent cases of transition and highly unusual hurricane developments and to address some of their wider implications for climate science. Frequently those dramatic cyclones are responsible for severe weather, potentially causing significant damage to property and infrastructure. An additional manifestation discussed here is their association with cold surges, a topic that has been very little explored in the literature. In the Southern Hemisphere, the first South Atlantic hurricane, Catarina, developed in March 2004 under very unusual large-scale conditions. That exceptional cyclone is viewed as a case of tropical transition facilitated by a well-developed blocking structure. A new index for monitoring tropical transition in the subtropical South Atlantic is discussed. This "South Atlantic index" is used to show that the unusual flow during and prior to Catarina's genesis can be attributed to tropical/extratropical interaction mechanisms. The "Donald Duck" case in Australia and Vince in the North Atlantic have also been examined and shown to belong to a category of hybrid-transitioning systems that will achieve at least partial tropical transition. While clearly more research is needed on the topic of transition, as we gain further insight, it is becoming increasingly apparent that features of large-scale circulation do play a fundamental role. A complex interaction between an extratropical transition case and an extreme summer cold surge affecting southeastern Australia is discussed as an example of wider climate implications.},

abstract = {In Ontario (Canada), the integration of renewable power is a priority policy goal. Since 2004, the circumstances under which the integration of renewable power is evaluated have changed due to successive changes in price as well as concerns that its over-production may add to grid congestion. This research investigates the value of increasing complementarity (both proximate and geographically dispersed) of wind and solar resources as a means by which electricity planners and researchers might advance electricity sustainability in Ontario. More specifically, this paper asks the following questions: 1) Does the combination of solar and wind resources in selected locations in Ontario serve to 'smooth out' power production, i.e., decrease instances of both high and low values, as compared to either resource producing individually? 2) Can this 'smoothness' be further improved by dispersing these resources geographically amongst locations? and 3) Does increasing the number of locations with solar and wind resources further 'smooth out' power production? Three years (2003-2005) of synchronous, hourly measurements of solar irradiance and wind speeds from Environment Canada's Canadian Weather Energy and Engineering Data Sets (CWEEDS) are used to derive dimensionless indices for four locations in Ontario (Toronto, Wiarton, Sault Ste. Marie and Ottawa). These indices are used to develop three transparent and accessible methods of analysis: (1) graphical representation; (2) percentile ranking; and (3) using a theoretical maximum as a proxy for capacity. The article concludes that the combination of solar and wind within locations and amongst two locations improves 'smoothness' in power production, as compared to when each resource is produced on its own; moreover, it is further improved once more than two resources and two locations are combined. However, there is neither further benefit, nor drawback, associated with the geographic dispersion of complementarity between solar in one location and wind in another, when compared to both resources in one location. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Accurate estimates of long-term linear trends of wind speed provide a useful indicator for circulation changes in the atmosphere and are invaluable for the planning and financing of sectors such as wind energy. Here a large number of wind observations over Australia and reanalysis products are analyzed to compute such trends. After a thorough quality control of the observations, it is found that the wind speed trends for 1975–2006 and 1989–2006 over Australia are sensitive to the height of the station: they are largely negative for the 2-m data but are predominantly positive for the 10-m data. The mean relative trend at 2 m is 20.10 6 0.03\%yr21 (20.3660.04\%yr21) for the 1975–2006 (1989–2006)period,whereas at 10 mit is 0.9060.03\%yr21 (0.69 6 0.04\% yr21) for the 1975–2006 (1989–2006) period. Also, at 10 m light winds tend to increase more rapidly than the mean winds, whereas strong winds increase less rapidly than the mean winds; at 2 m the trends in both light and strong winds vary in line with the mean winds. It was found that a qualitative link could be established between the observed features in the linear trends and some atmospheric circulation indicators (mean sea level pressure, wind speed at 850 hPa, and geopotential at 850 hPa), particularly for the 10-mobservations. Further, the magnitude of the trend is also sensitive to the period selected, being closer to zero when a very long period, 1948–2006, is considered. As a consequence, changes in the atmospheric circulation on climatic time scales appear unlikely.},

abstract = {Solar energy use in the UK is increasing dramatically, providing both heat energy and generation of electricity. This trend is expected to continue due to solar technologies becoming cheaper and more readily available along with low carbon government legislation such as the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and Feed in Tariffs (FiTs) supporting solar energy deployment. However, the effects of climate change on the solar resource remain largely unstudied. Climate change affects cloud cover characteristics and consequently directly affects the performance of solar energy technologies. This paper investigates the UK solar irradiation resource for both the present and future climates. The present solar irradiation level was assessed through the conversion of 30 years of observed historical monthly average sunshine duration data. The method and results are validated by comparing the converted solar irradiation levels to actual solar irradiance measurements at weather stations with significant historical records of solar irradiance data. The impact of climate change is investigated across different regions of the UK by using the UKCP09 probabilistic climate change projections. We find that the current average UK annual solar resource is 101.2Wm-2, ranging from 128.4 Wm-2 in the south of England to 71.8Wm-2 in the northwest of Scotland. It seems likely that climate change will increase the average resource in the south of the UK, while marginally decreasing it in the Northwest. The overall effect is a mean increase of the UK solar resource, however it will have greater seasonal variability and discrepancies between geographical regions will be reinforced. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel statistical downscaling method based on a non-linear classification technique known as self-organizing maps (SOMs) and has therefore been named SOM-SD. The relationship between large-scale atmospheric circulation and local-scale surface variable was constructed in a relatively simple and transparent manner. For a specific atmospheric state, an ensemble of possible values was generated for the predictand following the Monte Carlo method. Such a stochastic simulation is essential to explore the uncertainties of climate change in the future through a series of random re-sampling experiments. The novel downscaling method was evaluated by downscaling daily precipitation over Southeast Australia. The large-scale predictors were extracted from the daily NCAR/NCEP reanalysis data, while the predictand was high-resolution gridded daily observed precipitation (1958-2008) from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The results showed that the method works reasonably well across a variety of climatic zones in the study area. Overall, there was no particular zone that stands out as a climatic entity where the downscaling skill in reproducing all statistical indices was consistently lower or higher across seasons than the other zones. The method displayed a high skill in reproducing not only the climatologic statistical properties of the observed precipitation, but also the characteristics of the extreme precipitation events. Furthermore, the model was able to reproduce, to a certain extent, the inter-annual variability of precipitation characteristics.  2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Global surface pressure data from 1976 to 1997 from over 7500 land stations and the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set have been analyzed using harmonic and zonal harmonic methods. It is found that the diurnal pressure oscillation (S-1) is comparable to the semidiurnal pressure oscillation (S-2) in magnitude over much of the globe except for the low-latitude open oceans, where S-2 is about twice as strong as S-1. Over many land areas, such as the western United States, the Tibetan Plateau, and eastern Africa, S-1 is even stronger than S-2. This is in contrast to the conventional notion that S-2 predominates over much of the globe. The highest amplitudes (similar to 1.3 mb) of S-1 are found over northern South America and eastern Africa close to the equator. Here S-1 is also strong (similar to 1.1 mb) over high terrain such as the Rockies and the Tibetan Plateau. The largest amplitudes of S-2 (similar to 1.0-1.3 mb) are in the Tropics over South America, the eastern and western Pacific. and the Indian Ocean. Here S-1 peaks around 0600-0800 LST at low latitudes and around 1000-1200 LST over most of midlatitudes. while S-2 peaks around 1000 and 2200 LST over low- and midlatitudes. Here S-1 is much stronger over the land than over the ocean and its amplitude distribution is strongly influenced by landmasses, while the land-sea differences of S-2 are small. The spatial variations of S-1 correlate significantly with spatial variations in the diurnal temperature range at the surface, suggesting that sensible heating from the ground is a major forcing for S-1. Although S-2 is much more homogeneous zonally than S-1, there are considerable zonal variations in the amplitude of S-2 which cannot be explained by zonal variations in ozone and water vapor. Other forcings such as those through clouds' reflection and absorption of solar radiation and latent hearing in convective precipitation are needed to explain the observed regional and zonal variations in S-2. The migrating rides S-1 and S-2 predominate over other zonal wave components. However, the nonmigrating tides are substantially stronger than previously reported. The amplitudes of both the migrating and nonmigrating tides decrease rapidly poleward with a slower pace at middle and high latitudes.},

Unlike other existing reviews, we carry out a general review of this research area, without limiting ourselves to any particular issue or geographic location. We examine this area with respect to different types of renewable energy sources, different modes of operations, types of objective functions for optimization and different geographical areas from which research publication are emanating. We present a general resource allocation problem and specify different possibilities for input, output, objective function and constraints. In addition, we review different objectives used in defining the optimization problems. We also present different types of linear and non-linear optimization algorithms used in renewable energy sources. Finally, we review optimization techniques for applications with respect to different end users. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator coupled model (ACCESS-CM) has been developed at the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research (CAWCR), a partnership between CSIRO1 and the Bureau of Meteorology. It is built by coupling the UK Met Office atmospheric unified model (UM), and other sub-models as required, to the ACCESS ocean model, which consists of the NOAA/GFDL2 ocean model MOM4p1 and the LANL3 sea-ice model CICE4.1, under the CERFACS4 OASIS3.2-5 coupling framework. The primary goal of the ACCESS-CM development is to provide the Australian climate community with a new generation fully coupled climate model for climate research, and to participate in phase five of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5). This paper describes the ACCESS-CM framework and components, and presents the control climates from two versions of the ACCESS-CM, ACCESS1.0 and ACCESS1.3, together with some fields from the 20th century historical experiments, as part of model evaluation. While sharing the same ocean sea-ice model (except different setups for a few parameters), ACCESS1.0 and ACCESS1.3 differ from each other in their atmospheric and land surface components: the former is configured with the UK Met Office HadGEM2 (r1.1) atmospheric physics and the Met Office Surface Exchange Scheme land surface model version 2, and the latter with atmospheric physics similar to the UK Met Office Global Atmosphere 1.0 including modifications performed at CAWCR and the CSIRO Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange land surface model version 1.8. The global average annual mean surface air temperature across the 500-year preindustrial control integrations show a warming drift of 0.35 °C in ACCESS1.0 and 0.04 °C in ACCESS1.3. The overall skills of ACCESS-CM in simulating a set of key climatic fields both globally and over Australia significantly surpass those from the preceding CSIRO Mk3.5 model delivered to the previous coupled model inter-comparison. However, ACCESS-CM, like other CMIP5 models, has deficiencies in various aspects, and these are also discussed. Copyright © 2013, Common wealth of Australia.},

abstract = {The variability of wind and solar is perceived as a major obstacle in employing otherwise abundant renewable energy resources. On the basis of the available geographically dispersed data for theWestern USA, we analyze to what extent the geographic diversity of these resources can offset their variability. We determine the best match to loads in the western portion of the USA that can be achieved with wind power and photovoltaics (PV) with no transmission limitations. Without storage and with no curtailment, wind and PV can meet up to 50\% of loads in Western USA. It is beneficial to build more wind than PV mostly because the wind contributes at night.When storage is available, the optimal mix has almost 75\% as much nominal PV capacity as wind, with the PV energy contribution being 32\% of the electricity produced from wind. With only 10 GW of storage (twice the pumped hydro storage capacity that already exists in the Western Electric Coordinating Council), up to 82\% of the load can be matched with wind and PV, while in the same time curtailing just 10\% of the renewable energy throughout the year.

abstract = {The monthly mean shortwave (SW) radiation budget at the Earth's surface (SRB) was computed on 2.5-degree longitude-latitude resolution for the 17-year period from 1984 to 2000, using a radiative transfer model accounting for the key physical parameters that determine the surface SRB, and long-term climatological data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP-D2). The model input data were supplemented by data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction - National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) and European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Global Reanalysis projects, and other global data bases such as TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and Global Aerosol Data Set (GADS). The model surface radiative fluxes were validated against surface measurements from 22 stations of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) covering the years 1992-2000, and from 700 stations of the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA), covering the period 1984-2000. The model is in good agreement with BSRN and GEBA, with a negative bias of 14 and 6.5 Wm-2, respectively. The model is able to reproduce interesting features of the seasonal and geographical variation of the surface SW fluxes at global scale. Based on the 17-year average model results, the global mean SW downward surface radiation (DSR) is equal to 171.6 Wm-2, whereas the net downward (or absorbed) surface SW radiation is equal to 149.4 Wm-2, values that correspond to 50.2 and 43.7\% of the incoming SW radiation at the top of the Earth's atmosphere. These values involve a long-term surface albedo equal to 12.9\%. Significant increasing trends in DSR and net DSR fluxes were found, equal to 4.1 and 3.7 Wm-2, respectively, over the 1984-2000 period (equivalent to 2.4 and 2.2 Wm-2 per decade), indicating an increasing surface solar radiative heating. This surface SW radiative heating is primarily attributed to clouds, especially low-level, and secondarily to other parameters such as total precipitable water. The surface solar heating occurs mainly in the period starting from the early 1990s, in contrast to decreasing trend in DSR through the late 1980s. The computed global mean DSR and net DSR flux anomalies were found to range within 8 and 6 Wm-2, respectively, with signals from El Ni\~{n}o and La Ni\~{n}a events, and the Pinatubo eruption, whereas significant positive anomalies have occurred in the period 1992-2000.},

abstract = {As the renewable energy industry continues to grow so does the requirement for atmospheric modeling and analysis tools to maximize both wind and solar power. Renewable energy generation is variable however; presenting challenges for electrical grid operation and requires a variety of measures to adequately firm power. These measures include the production of non-renewable generation during times when renewables are not available. One strategy for minimizing the variability of renewable energy production is site diversity. Assuming that a network of renewable energy systems feed a common electrical grid, site diversity ensures that when one system on the network has a reduction in generation others on the same grid make up the difference. Part one of this paper introduced ReNOT and its capabilities. This paper presents two case studies on applying ReNOT to the wind and solar farm industry, respectively. As part of collaboration with Rocky Mountain Supercomputing Center (RMSC) and the State of Montana a study was performed to estimate the optimal locations of a network of wind farms. Comparisons were made to four existing wind farm locations in Montana including Glacier with a 210 MW name plate capacity, Horseshoe Bend with a total capacity of 9 MW, Diamond Willow with a capacity of 20MW and Judith Gap with a total capacity of 135 MW. The goal of this study was to see if ReNOT could find a four site network that made more effective use of the existing four site network of wind farms' 374 MW nameplate capacity. We developed three different metrics in which to pick sites. Metric 1 (M1) picks sites that converges on the single best location for power production, on average. Metric 2 (M2) picks sites that maximizes geographical diversity, even at the expense of very poor aggregate power. Metric 3 (M3) picks sites based on the previous day's mean power, and accounts for short-term variability (i.e., 1 hour). In a sense M3 attempts to approximate usable power by minimizing ramping events which are so important to industry. In addition we investigated several performance metrics including Mean Power, Usable Power, and ramping event frequency. A ramping event is defined as an increase or decrease in power production over the course of one hour. Of interest was the frequency of ramping events that exceeded 10\% of total capacity for the network. Networks with few ramping events are markedly superior to networks producing otherwise identical aggregate power. The optimization was run over the 15 year period (1995-2009) of hub-height wind data (40 meters AGL). Figure 1 indicates the existing wind farms in white while the optimized network is shown in yellow. The ReNOT derived network produces 58\% more usable power than the four existing and operating wind farms denoted in white. In addition, the optimized four site network produces three times fewer significant ramping events. The solar study was performed over south Florida. The goal of this study was to see if ReNOT could find four optimal locations that exceed the peformance of a randomly picked four site solar farm network. The optimization was performed over a 15 year period (1995-2009) using a GOES derived cloud analysis at 4km and 15 minute resolution, respectively. As with the wind study we developed a cost function that emphasizes network stability, total power and day ahead forecastability. Networks with more consistent day to day cloud cover and are more accurately forecastable by a day in advance will be favored by ReNOT. Figure 2 shows the results of the optimization. The white x's represent the randomly picked solar farms while the red, yellow and white dots represent the top three networks from the ReNOT run. ReNOT prefers sites on the west coast of Florida due to favorable cloud conditions. However the optimized networks only produce 10\% additional power than the existing/proposed sites. This is due to the limited area within which the optimization was artificially constrained (yellow box). The runs performed in this study were made with out regard to other practicle restrictions for example, building in state parks, population centers or within proximity to electrical grid infrastructure. However, we are currently adding this capability into ReNOT. Additional detailed results will be presented at the conference.},

The distribution of cyclones through the hemisphere was found to be dominated by a permanent high latitude core coincident with the circumpolar trough. During the winter and intermediate seasons, two mid latitude branches are evident in the cyclone density originating in the Tasman Sea and South American sectors, both spiraling poleward and merging with the circumpolar core in the Southern Oceans. Systems were observed to move in an east-south-east direction, away from their location of formation, exhibiting peak speeds of migration in the mid latitudes. Little seasonality was evident in the density distribution of cyclones through the Southern Oceans, but a considerable amount was found in their central pressure.},

Here, our weather-driven methodology is described and applied to model the Danish power system with combined wind and solar energy gross shares of up to 100\% of the total demand. We show that in a wind only scenario, surplus energy grows rapidly beyond gross shares of about 50\%, while the potential for arbitrage of surplus renewable energy, i.e. demand-side management or high-efficiency storage, is very limited in this case. A scenario with a wind-solar energy mix of 80/20, on the other hand, both decreases??the total amount of surplus and has a significantly higher potential for arbitrage of the remaining surplus. However, beyond gross shares of about 75\%, only large-scale seasonal storage of, e.g. hydrogen, enables the use of Danish surplus wind and solar energy to cover the residual Danish electricity demand in both scenarios. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {As wind farms become larger, the asymptotic limit of the ‘fully developed’, or ‘infinite’, wind farm has been receiving an increased interest. This limit is relevant for wind farms on flat terrain whose length exceeds the height of the atmospheric boundary layer by over an order of magnitude. Recent computational studies based on large eddy simulation have identi- fied various mean velocity equilibrium layers and have led to parameterizations of the effective roughness height that allow the prediction of the wind velocity at hub height as a function of parameters such as wind turbine spacing and loading factors. In the current paper, we employ this as a tool in making predictions of optimal wind turbine spacing as a function of these parameters, as well as in terms of the ratio of turbine costs to land surface costs. For realistic cost ratios, we find that the optimal average turbine spacing may be considerably higher than that conventionally used in current wind farm implementations.

abstract = {Least cost options are presented for supplying the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) with 100\% renewable electricity using wind, photovoltaics, concentrating solar thermal (CST) with storage, hydroelectricity and biofuelled gas turbines. We use a genetic algorithm and an existing simulation tool to identify the lowest cost (investment and operating) scenarios of renewable technologies and locations for NEM regional hourly demand and observed weather in 2010 using projected technology costs for 2030. These scenarios maintain the NEM reliability standard, limit hydroelectricity generation to available rainfall, and limit bioenergy consumption. The lowest cost scenarios are dominated by wind power, with smaller contributions from photovoltaics and dispatchable generation: CST, hydro and gas turbines. The annual cost of a simplified transmission network to balance supply and demand across NEM regions is a small proportion of the annual cost of the generating system. Annual costs are compared with a scenario where fossil fuelled power stations in the NEM today are replaced with modern fossil substitutes at projected 2030 costs, and a carbon price is paid on all emissions. At moderate carbon prices, which appear required to address climate change, 100\% renewable electricity would be cheaper on an annual basis than the replacement scenario. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Policy makers face difficult choices in planning to decarbonise their electricity industries in the face of significant technology and economic uncertainties. To this end we compare the projected costs in 2030 of one medium-carbon and two low-carbon fossil fuel scenarios for the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) against the costs of a previously published scenario for 100\% renewable electricity in 2030. The three new fossil fuel scenarios, based on the least cost mix of baseload and peak load power stations in 2010, are: (i) a medium-carbon scenario utilising only gas-fired combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) and open cycle gas turbines (OCGTs); (ii) coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) plus peak load OCGT; and (iii) gas-fired CCGT with CCS plus peak load OCGT. We perform sensitivity analyses of the results to future carbon prices, gas prices, and CO2 transportation and storage costs which appear likely to be high in most of Australia. We find that only under a few, and seemingly unlikely, combinations of costs can any of the fossil fuel scenarios compete economically with 100\% renewable electricity in a carbon constrained world. Our findings suggest that policies pursuing very high penetrations of renewable electricity based on commercially available technology offer a cost effective and low risk way to dramatically cut emissions in the electricity sector. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Despite the wide range of modelling approaches used and multiplicity of assumptions made, it is shown that forecasts can be usefully compared along two dimensions, namely: shape of future production profile and assumed or implied ultimately recoverable resource of conventional oil. Other differences between forecasts are either secondary or are components of these two parameters. The paper shows how large differences in the assumed size of the resource make relatively little difference to the timing of a global peak in conventional oil production. It also examines the impact of rates of discovery, reserves growth and depletion on the forecast date of peak and shows how forecasts that delay this peak until beyond 2030 rest on assumptions that are at best optimistic and at worst implausible. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The New South Wales (NSW) coast is subject to heavy rain, strong wind$\backslash$nand large waves resulting from low pressure systems over the adjacent$\backslash$nTasman Sea that develop from a variety of synoptic and mesoscale$\backslash$nmechanisms. A database of these maritime lows and their impacts has$\backslash$nbeen developed in the NSW Climate Services Centre of the Bureau of$\backslash$nMeteorology. The database currently extends back to 1970 and includes$\backslash$ndata on rainfall amounts, with wind speed and significant wave height$\backslash$ndata still to be added. The database events were classified into$\backslash$nsix synoptic types based on the mean sea level pressure synoptic$\backslash$npattern in which the lows formed. The six types are: inland trough$\backslash$nlows (30 per cent), easterly trough lows (14 per cent), and ex-tropical$\backslash$ncyclones (4 per cent), all of which originate in the subtropical$\backslash$nor tropical easterlies; and, lows forming on a wave on a front (37$\backslash$nper cent) decaying front lows (12 per cent) and lows in the westerlies$\backslash$n(3 per cent), the latter two of which originate from mid-latitude$\backslash$nlow pressure systems or fronts in the westerlies. Since 1970, only$\backslash$ninland trough lows have shown a significant increase in frequency$\backslash$nwhich is consistent with a slight increase in spring rainfall in$\backslash$nan area over northeast NSW over the same period. In contrast, there$\backslash$nhas been a decrease in ex-tropical cyclone numbers impacting the$\backslash$nNSW coast since 1970, which is consistent with a decrease in summer$\backslash$nrainfall generally along the NSW coast.

abstract = {The Eastern SeaBoard (ESB) of Australia has long been recognised as a separate climate entity. Using the latest gridded observations from the Bureau of Meteorology, a definition of the spatial extent of the ESB is proposed. It appears that, while this area has recorded below average rainfall over the last 12 years, the ongoing deficiency is not record breaking in historic terms. This contrasts with record breaking droughts across large parts of inland, eastern Australia. The lesser severity of ongoing rainfall deficiencies in the ESB, compared to the rest of the region, is linked to the different impact of observed changes in regional surface pressure and, in particular, changes in the position of the sub-tropical ridge. It is also observed that while tropical modes of variability in the Pacific and Indian oceans are known to influence the climate of eastern Australia, that influence appears very weak and not statistically significant across the ESB. Finally, some issues relevant to future rainfall projections for the ESB are discussed. It is argued that providing reliable climate projections across this climatic region is a difficult challenge.},

In order to develop its estimation method, we investigate the relationship between the largest output fluctuation and the standard deviation of a newly proposed random variable generated by differencing the output vari- ation of photovoltaic power generation systems. Output fluctuation coefficients are defined and estimated using measured data of photovoltaic power generation systems located at 52 places. An approximation equation is pre- sented to predict geographical correlations between the proposed random variables for photovoltaic power systems by using the distances between their locations. Finally, it is shown that the largest output fluctuation of many photovol- taic power generation systems dispersed in a wide area is predictable by using the output fluctuation coefficients and the equation approximating the geographical correlations of output fluctuations.},

abstract = {Given the recent increasing public focus on climate change issues, there is a need for robust, sustainable and climate friendly power transmission and distribution systems that are intelligent, reliable, and green. Current power systems create environmental impacts as well as contributing to global warming due to their utilization of fossil fuels, especially coal, as carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere. In contrast to fossil fuels, renewable energy is starting to be used as the panacea for solving climate change or global warming problems. This paper describes a feasibility study undertaken to investigate the potentialities of renewable energy including the prospective locations in Australia for renewable energy generation, in particular solar and wind energy. Initially, a hybrid model has been developed to investigate the prospects of wind energy for typical Australian region considering production cost, cost of energy, emission production and contribution from renewable energy using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER), a computer model developed by the USA's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This model also explores suitable places around Australia for wind energy generation using statistical analysis. Subsequently, the usefulness of solar energy in the Australian context and suitable locations for solar energy generation are also investigated using a similar hybrid model. Finally, the model has been developed to investigate the prospects of renewable energy in particular wind and solar energy including specific locations in Australia that would be suitable for both wind and solar energy generation. From simulation analysis it is clearly observed that Australia has enormous potentialities for substantially increased use of renewable energy; a large penetration of renewable energy sources into the national power system would reduce CO2 emissions significantly, contributing to the reduction of global warming. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mean monthly wind speed at 70 m above ground level is investigated for 11 sites in Minnesota for the period 1995–2003. Wind speeds at these sites show significant spatial and temporal coherence, with pro- longed periods of above- and below-normal values that can persist for as long as 12 months. Monthly variation in wind speed primarily is determined by the north–south pressure gradient, which captures between 22\% and 47\% of the variability (depending on the site). Regression on wind speed residuals (pressure gradient effects removed) shows that an additional 6\%–15\% of the variation can be related to the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Ni\~{n}o-3.4 sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Wind speeds showed little correspondence with variation in the Pacific–North American (PNA) circulation index. The effect of the strong El Ni\~{n}o of 1997/98 on the wind speed time series was investigated by recomputing the regression equations with this period excluded. The north–south pressure gradient remains the primary determinant of mean monthly 70-m wind speeds, but with 1997/98 removed the influence of the AO increases at nearly all stations while the importance of the Ni\~{n}o-3.4 SSTs generally decreases. Relationships with the PNA remain small. These results suggest that long-term patterns of low-frequency wind speed (and thus wind power) variability can be estimated using large-scale circulation features as represented by large-scale climatic datasets and by climate-change models.},

However, the variability of these renewable sources of electricity poses technical and economical challenges when integrated on a large scale. Energy storage is being widely regarded as one of the potential solutions to deal with the variations of variable renewable electricity sources (VRES). This paper presents an up-to-date review of the state of technology, installations and some challenges of electrical energy storage (EES) systems. It particularly focuses on the applicability, advantages and disadvantages of various EES technologies for large-scale VRES integration. This survey paper indicates that each challenge imposed by VRES requires a different set of EES characteristics to address the issue, and that there is no single EES technology that consistently outperforms the others in various applications. This paper also discusses external factors, such as mineral availability and geographic limitations, that may affect the success of the widespread implementation of EES technologies. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the accuracy of several models for estimating daily solar radiation (Q) across Australia. Data from 39 sites were taken from MetAccess. The sites were grouped into four climatic zones. Coefficients of nine models, including two newly developed formulae, were fitted for the 39 sites. Correlation coefficients (R2) between estimated Q and measured Q and root mean squared error (RMSE) associated with the estimates were calculated. It was concluded that models which expressed rainfall as a binary quantity (1 for rainfall > 0; 0 for rainfall = 0) performed better than those using amount of rainfall (precipitation in mm). The best performed models, one using temperature data only, one using rainfall data only and one using rainfall and temperature were further evaluated. A newly developed model that included temperatures (minimum and maximum) and rain-day information proved the best method. Using the coefficients for estimates of Q at the same sites, averaged R2 was 0.68, 0.74 and 0.79 and RMSE was 3.24, 3.05 and 2.89 MJ m-2, for the model using rainfall only, temperature only and both rainfall and temperature, respectively. When Q was estimated using the coefficients from other sites, estimation of Q within eastern and southern zones were more reliable than in northern and central zones. In general, the model using both temperature and rainfall was the best model for either estimated Q for the site where coefficients of the model were developed at the site or imported from other sites. However, in some tropical coastal sites of Australia, such as Broome and Darwin, estimates of Q based on rainfall only can be more reliable when the coefficients were imported from other sites. It was concluded that radiation within a similar climatic region could be well estimated with no local recording, regardless of distance between sites. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Several methodologies exist for evaluating the economic potential of renewable energy sources. These methodologies either cannot capture how this economic potential depends on its embedding in the whole energy mix, or provide a single cost-optimal energy mix, which is not flexible enough for building consensus among the relevant stakeholders. This article addresses these two limitations and introduces a novel methodology EXPANSE (EXploration of PAtterns in Near-optimal energy ScEnarios) for evaluating the economic potential of renewable energy sources from an energy mix perspective. This methodology is based on generation of cost-optimal and multiple near-optimal energy mixes. These mixes show the maximum, technically feasible, cost-effective potential of a renewable energy source under consideration and how this potential depends on the other supply alternatives and energy savings in an energy mix. The methodology is illustrated with the example of the renewable energy use for heat supply in a Swiss region. The example shows that even a particular renewable energy source is costlier than the currently deployed alternatives such as oil, its economic potential in an energy mix can be as high as its full exploitable (theoretical) potential, when some deviation is allowed from the cost-optimal energy mix. However, the full economic potential of all renewable energy sources cannot be utilized simultaneously. The full deployment of the economic potential of one renewable energy source decreases the economic potential of others. EXPANSE provides basis for analyzing such interlinkages. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This work documents how the midlatitude, eddy-driven jets respond to climate change using model output from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The authors consider separately the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, and the Southern Hemisphere jets. The analysis is not limited to annual- mean changes in the latitude and speed of the jets, but also explores how the variability of each jet changes with increased greenhouse gases. All jets are found to migrate poleward with climate change: the Southern Hemisphere jet shifts poleward by 28 of latitude between the historical period and the end of the twenty-first century in the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario, whereas both Northern Hemisphere jets shift by only 18.In addition, the speed of the Southern Hemisphere jet is found to increase markedly (by 1.2ms21 between 850 and 700 hPa), while the speed remains nearly constant for both jets in the Northern Hemisphere. More importantly, it is found that the patterns of jet variability are a strong function of the jet position in all three sectors of the globe, and as the jets shift poleward the patterns of variability change. Specifically, for the Southern Hemisphere and the North Atlantic jets, the variability becomes less of a north–south wobbling and more of a pulsing (i.e., variation in jet speed). In contrast, for the North Pacific jet, the variability becomes less of a pulsing and more of a north–south wobbling. These different responses can be understood in terms of Rossby wave breaking, allowing the authors to explain most of the projected jet changes within a single dynamical framework.},

abstract = {Wind and solar PV generation data for the entire contiguous US are calculated, on the basis of 32 years of weather data with temporal resolution of one hour and spatial resolution of 40×40 km2 , assuming site-suitability-based as well as stochastic wind and solar PV capacity distributions throughout the country. These data are used to investigate a fully renewable electricity system, resting primarily upon wind and solar PV power. We find that the seasonal optimal mix of wind and solar PV comes at around 80\% solar PV share, owing to the US summer load peak. By picking this mix, long-term storage requirements can be more than halved compared to a wind only mix. The daily optimal mix lies at about 80\% wind share due to the nightly gap in solar PV production. Picking this mix instead of solar only reduces backup energy needs by about 50\%. Furthermore, we calculate shifts in FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)-level LCOE (Levelized Costs Of Electricity) for wind and solar PV due to their differing resource quality and fluctuation patterns. LCOE vary by up to 35\% due to regional conditions, and LCOE-optimal mixes turn out to largely follow resource quality. A transmission network enhancement among FERC regions is constructed to transfer high penetrations of solar and wind across FERC boundaries, based on a novel least-cost optimization approach.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the history, the present status and possible future developments of photovoltaic (PV) materials for terrestrial applications. After a brief history and introduction of the photovoltaic effect theoretical requirements for the optimal performance of materials for pn-junction solar cells are discussed. Most important are efficiency, long-term stability and, not to be neglected, lowest possible cost. Today the market is dominated by crystalline silicon in its multicrystalline and monocrystalline form. The physical and technical limitations of this material are discussed. Although crystalline silicon is not the optimal material from a solid state physics point of view it dominates the market and will continue to do this for the next 5–10 years. Because of its importance a considerable part of this review deals with materials aspects of crystalline silicon. For reasons of cost only multicrystalline silicon and monocrystalline Czochralski (Cz) crystals are used in practical cells. Light induced instability in this Cz-material has recently been investigated and ways to eliminate this effect have been devised. For future large scale production of crystalline silicon solar cells development of a special solar grade silicon appears necessary. Ribbon growth is a possibility to avoid the costly sawing process. A very vivid R\&D area is thin-film crystalline silicon (about 5–30$\mu$m active layer thickness) which would avoid the crystal growing and sawing processes. The problems arising for this material are: assuring adequate light absorption, assuring good crystal quality and purity of the films, and finding a substrate that fulfills all requirements. Three approaches have emerged: high-temperature, low-temperature and transfer technique. Genuine thin-film materials are characterized by a direct band structure which gives them very high light absorption. Therefore, these materials have a thickness of only one micron or less. The oldest such material is amorphous silicon which is the second most important material today. It is mainly used in consumer products but is on the verge to also penetrate the power market. Other strong contenders are chalcogenides like copper indium diselenide (CIS) and cadmium telluride. The interest has expanded from CuInSe2, to CuGaSe2, CuInS2 and their multinary alloys Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2. The two deposition techniques are either separate deposition of the components followed by annealing on one hand or coevaporation. Laboratory efficiencies for small area devices are approaching 19\% and large area modules have reached 12\%. Pilot production of CIS-modules has started in the US and Germany. Cadmium telluride solar cells also offer great promise. They have only slightly lower efficiency and are also at the start of production. In the future other materials and concepts can be expected to come into play. Some of these are: dye sensitized cells, organic solar cells and various concentrating systems including III/V-tandem cells. Theoretical materials that have not yet been realized are Auger generation material and intermediate metallic band material.},

abstract = {Energy systems can be vulnerable to climate change. This paper summarizes the contribution of their authors to a few strategic studies, research workshops, development forum and international conferences related to Climate and Energy. It presents a review of the impacts that climate change may have throughout the energy chain and identifies current knowledge gaps and areas for future research development. One of the greatest challenges is how to assess impacts which may occur as a consequence of the projected increase in the intensity of extreme weather events: the majority of current methodologies rely on past experience but this may not be a sufficiently good guide for planning and operational activities in the coming decades. Also, climate impact assessments on energy planning and operation need to take into account a greater number of scenarios, as well as investigate impacts on particular energy segments. Therefore, we identify energy segments for which little climate impact research has been conducted. Finally, because climate impact assessment for energy systems is a relatively new research field, it is expected that methodological developments will increase in the near future with a consequent broadening of the knowledge base on the subject. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Wind is the world's fastest growing electric energy source. Because it is intermittent, though, wind is not used to supply baseload electric power today. Interconnecting wind farms through the transmission grid is a simple and effective way of reducing deliverable wind power swings caused by wind intermittency. As more farms are interconnected in an array, wind speed correlation among sites decreases and so does the probability that all sites experience the same wind regime at the same time. The array consequently behaves more and more similarly to a single farm with steady wind speed and thus steady deliverable wind power. In this study, benefits of interconnecting wind farms were evaluated for 19 sites, located in the midwestern United States, with annual average wind speeds at 80 m above ground, the hub height of modern wind turbines, greater than 6.9 ms(-1) (class 3 or greater). It was found that an average of 33\% and a maximum of 47\% of yearly averaged wind power from interconnected farms can be used as reliable, baseload electric power. Equally significant, interconnecting multiple wind farms to a common point and then connecting that point to a far-away city can allow the long-distance portion of transmission capacity to be reduced, for example, by 20\% with only a 1.6\% loss of energy. Although most parameters, such as intermittency, improved less than linearly as the number of interconnected sites increased, no saturation of the benefits was found. Thus, the benefits of interconnection continue to increase with more and more interconnected sites.},

abstract = {This work presents an updated climatology of blocking episodes for the Southern Hemisphere between 1960 and 2000, based on data from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. Five contiguous areas of blocking activity are considered; Southeastern Pacific, Southwestern Pacific, Atlantic, Indian and Oceania. The impact of the three most important areas of onset blocking episodes (Southeastern Pacific, Atlantic and Oceania) upon the climate of the adjacent continental areas (South America and Australia) was evaluated. Composites of the meteorological variables (temperature and precipitation) were obtained for periods of diagnosed blockings. The impact of the blocking episodes over the climate of South America and Australia is highlighted whenever anomaly fields of temperature and precipitation are significant at the 5\% and 10\% levels, respectively. Impacts of Southeastern Pacific and Atlantic blockings are observed on the temperature field over several regions of South America. Significantly higher (lower) temperatures than climatology occur in southern Brazil, northern Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, and lower (higher) than climatology in the extreme south of South America for the Southeastern Pacific (Atlantic) blocking episodes. Precipitation over South America is also affected by the Southeastern Pacific and Atlantic blockings in different ways. The Southeastern Pacific blocking has higher impact on precipitation in summer (dry conditions in northeast Brazil) and spring (wet conditions in central and southern Brazil), while the Atlantic blocking affects precipitation in autumn and winter (wet conditions in parts of central and southern Brazil). The blocking cases over Oceania affect southeastern Australia with normal to higher than climatological precipitation and with negative temperature anomalies in that region. Finally we provide a detailed analysis of a South Atlantic blocking episode, which occurred between the 4th and the 8th of June 1997. This event shows clearly the split of the jet stream into two branches (subtropical and polar) surrounding the anticyclonic sector, and satellite imagery revealed the presence of transient systems in the periphery of the blocking anticyclone responsible for high values of precipitation in the southeastern sector of South America.

This paper deals with the smoothing of power fluctuations because of geographical dispersion of PV systems. The fluctuation frequency and the maximum fluctuation registered at a PV plant ensemble are analyzed to study these effects. We propose an empirical expression to compare the fluctuation attenuation because of both the size and the number of PV plants grouped. The convolution of single PV plants frequency distribution functions has turned out to be a successful tool to statistically describe the behavior of an ensemble of PV plants and determine their maximum output fluctuation.

In the field of content-based image retrieval (CBIR), the analysis of gray scale images has got very much importance because of its immense application starting from satellite images to medical images. But the analysis of an image with such number of gray shades becomes very complex, so, for simplicity we cluster the image into a lesser number of gray levels. Using k-means clustering algorithm we can cluster an image to obtain segments. The main disadvantage of the k-means algorithm is that the number of clusters, K, must be supplied as a parameter. Again, this method does not specify the optimal cluster number. In this paper, we have provided a mathematical approach to determine the optimal cluster number of a clustered grayscale images. A simple index, based on the intra-cluster and inter-cluster distance measures has been proposed in this paper, which allows the number of clusters to be determined automatically.},

abstract = {To transmit electric bulk power in an economic and efficient way over long distances up to several 1000 km it is necessary to use Ultra-High-Voltages (UHV), i.e. AC (alternating current)-voltages of 1000 kV and DC (direct current)-voltages of ??800 kV or higher. Especially the UHVDC (ultra high voltage direct current) transmission is one of the key solutions to transmit bulk power over very large distances. Two bipolar systems with transmission voltage of ??800 kV, transmission power up to 7.2 GW and length of up to 2000 km are in operation in China since 2010 and additional systems especially in China and India are planned. So it seems that the UHVDC technology is state of the art and can be used easily. But there are some restrictions which make it difficult to use UHVDC transmission in all cases. To analyze this in detail, the state of the art of long distance UHVDC transmission systems is summarized and the possible future development is analyzed. Different aspects are discussed, which will possibly limit the use of the UHVDC technology in future. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The leading modes of variability of the extratropical circulation in both hemispheres are characterized by deep, zonally symmetric or "annular" structures, with geopotential height perturbations of opposing signs in the polar cap region and in the surrounding zonal ring centered near 45 degrees latitude. The structure and dynamics of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode have been extensively documented, whereas the existence of a Northern Hemisphere (NH) mode, herein referred to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), has only recently been recognized. Like the SH mode, the AO can be defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function of the sea level pressure field or of the zonally symmetric geopotential height or zonal wind fields. In this paper the; structure and seasonality of the NH and SH modes are compared based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis and supplementary datasets. The structures of the NH and SH annular modes are shown to be remarkably similar, not only in the zonally averaged geopotential height and zonal wind fields, but in the mean meridional circulations as well. Both exist year-round in the troposphere, but they amplify with height upward into the stratosphere during those seasons in which the strength of the zonal flow is conducive to strong planetary wave-mean how interaction: midwinter in the NH and late spring in the SH. During these "active seasons," the annular modes modulate the strength of the Lagrangian mean circulation in the lower stratosphere, total column ozone and tropopause height over mid- and high latitudes, and the strength of the trade winds of their respective hemispheres. The NH mode also contains an embedded planetary wave signature with expressions in surface air temperature, precipitation, total column ozone, and tropopause height. It is argued that the horizontal temperature advection by the perturbed zonal-mean zonal wind field in the lower troposphere is instrumental in forcing this pattern. A companion paper documents the striking resemblance between the structure of the annular modes and observed climate trends over the past few decades.},

abstract = {From 1979 to 1989, global European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses of many meteorological variables important in baroclinic storms have been bandpass filtered to highlight fluctuations on 2- to 8-day time scales in order to illuminate the relationships among the variables in baroclinic storm-track regions. Because of the greater zonal symmetry in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) versus the Northern Hemisphere (NH), it is possible to examine these relationships over a zonal sector without being dominated by local effects associated with jet stream entrance and exit regions of the storm tracks. The bandpassed variance of geopotential height is used to define the storm track, and its meridional profile has a pronounced midlatitude maximum in the SH. The locations of the jet stream and the variance maxima of meridional and zonal velocity components, vorticity, vertical motion, specific humidity, and temperature all bear a distinctive relationship to the storm track, but the latitudes of their maxima are displaced from the center of the storm track. Many covariance quantities such as the transient eddy temperature, moisture, vorticity, and vertical and horizontal momentum fluxes also exhibit a strong storm-track signature. The observed relationships among the eddy quantities can generally be understood in terms of geostrophic theory and perturbation analysis applied to baroclinic systems. Storm-track activity is remarkably persistent throughout the year in both location and intensity in the SH. The storm track is farthest poleward in the transition seasons as part of a semiannual cycle, but remains near 50°S year round, and is strongest in the southern Indian Ocean and weakest in the South Pacific. There is a strong relationship between the storm track and the major tropospheric polar jet stream and its associated lower-level baroclinicity throughout the year, and the distribution of storm-track activity can be accounted for by baroclinic theory. In contrast to the NH, strongest meridional temperature gradients in middle latitudes are found in the summer half-year in the SH. Whereas the NH storm-track activity is much weaker in summer and shifts poleward, the SH activity is as strong as in winter and, if anything, shifts slightly equatorward. The zonal symmetry is greater in summer and meridional profiles are sharper, implying less variability in the storm track both within and between seasons. In winter, high-frequency storm-track activity extends over a broader range of latitudes and continues to be mainly associated with the polar jet stream. The question of the impact of the storm-track eddies on the mean flow is examined using zonal mean and a localized Eliassen–Palm flux. Baroclinic effects from the poleward heat flux dominate in winter and the eddies act to decelerate the upper tropospheric westerlies. Barotropic effects in the upper troposphere, mostly from the meridional momentum flux convergence, help to maintain the mean westerly distribution by accelerating the main polar jet and maintaining the mean split in the flow near New Zealand in both summer and winter and even dominate the baroclinic component in the storm track in summer. Diabatic heating by the eddies may also help maintain the mean flow.},

abstract = {Satellite observations suggest that the thermal radiation emitted by Earth to space increased by more than 5 watts per square meter, while reflected sunlight decreased by less than 2 watts per square meter, in the tropics over the period 1985-2000, with most of the increase occurring after 1990. By analyzing temporal changes in the frequency of occurrence of emitted thermal and reflected solar fluxes, the effects of El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation are minimized, and an independent longer-time-scale variation of the radiation budget is identified. Similar analyses of upper tropospheric humidity, cloud amount, surface air temperature, and vertical velocity confirm that these flux changes are associated with a decadal-time-scale strengthening of the tropical Hadley and Walker circulations. Equatorial convective regions have intensified in upward motion and moistened, while both the equatorial and subtropical subsidence regions have become drier and less cloudy.},

The frequency of occurrence of each of these synoptic patterns has been calculated for each 3-month season from 1979 to 2001. The effect of variations in the relative frequency of these synoptic patterns on maximum daily temperature in Melbourne, in the southeast of the country, has been examined. The effects of frequency variations on the mean summer-winter temperature difference, on the variations in mean temperature from year-to-year and on the temperature trend 1979-2001 have all been examined. Changes in the frequency of occurrence of synoptic patterns between seasons have a measurable influence on the mean summer-winter temperature difference. Variations in winter temperatures from year-to-year are closely related to the frequency of a few synoptic patterns, and changes in the frequency of these patterns have contributed to the observed temperature trends. Relationships between temperature and the frequency of synoptic patterns in summer are weaker than the case for winter. The implications are discussed. Copyright © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society},

Nomograms of the relation between point measurements and area averages are given for different space-time-averaging intervals. Examples from the nomograms show, for instance, that under conditions of low mean radiation (cloudy days), the central site point measurements are representative of a spatial area the size of a T42 GCM grid box (280 km x 280 km) if one uses hourly averages and is willing to accept a correlation of 0.45 between area average and point measurement. The point data represent a 60 km x 60 km region at a 0.90 correlation level if a 5-min time average is used. The characteristic timescale for the within-day radiation variability was roughly 60 min. Estimates of scale lengths for days when the mean background radiation conditions are high are also given in the nomographs.},

abstract = {The performance of the WRF mesoscale model in the wind simulation and wind energy estimates was assessed and evaluated under different initial and boundary forcing conditions. Due to the continuous evolution and progress in the development of reanalyses datasets, this work aims to compare an older, yet widely used, reanalysis (the NCEP-R2) with three recently released reanalyses datasets that represent the new generation of this type of data (ERA-Interim, NASA-MERRA and NCEP-CFSR). Due to its intensive use in wind energy assessment studies, the NCEP-GFS and NCEP-FNL analysis were also used to drive WRF and its results compared to those of the simulations driven by reanalyses.Six different WRF simulations were conducted and their results compared to measured wind data collected at thirteen wind measuring stations located in Portugal in areas of high wind energy potential. Based on the analysis and results presented in this work, it can be concluded that the new generation reanalyses are able to provide a considerable improvement in wind simulation when compared to the older reanalyses. Among all the initial and boundary conditions datasets tested here, ERA-Interim reanalysis is the one that likely provides the most realistic initial and boundary data, providing the best estimates of the local wind regimes and potential wind energy production. The NCEP-GFS and NCEP-FNL analyses seem to be the best alternatives to ERA-Interim, showing better results than all the other reanalyses datasets here tested, and can therefore be considered as valid alternatives to ERA-Interim, in particular for cases where reliable forcing data is needed for real-time applications due to its fast availability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {urricanes are causing increasing damage to many coastal regions worldwide1,2 . Offshore wind turbines can provide sub- stantial clean electricity year-round, but can they also mitigate hurricane damage while avoiding damage to themselves? This study uses an advanced climate–weather computer model that correctly treats the energy extraction of wind turbines3,4 to examine this question. It finds that large turbine arrays (300+GWinstalled capacity) may diminish peak near-surface hurricane wind speeds by 25–41ms−1 (56–92 mph) and storm surge by 6–79\%. Benefits occur whether turbine arrays are placed immediately upstream of a city or along an expanse of coastline. The reduction in wind speed due to large arrays increases the probability of survival of even present turbine designs. The net cost of turbine arrays (capital plus operation cost less cost reduction from electricity generation and from health, climate, and hurricane damage avoidance) is estimated to be less than today’s fossil fuel electricity generation net cost in these regions and less than the net cost of sea walls used solely to avoid storm surge damage.

In this article, we review the major developments and climatological applications of SOMs in the literature. The SOM can be used in synoptic climatological analysis in a manner similar to most other clustering methods. However, as the results from a SOM are generally represented by a two-dimensional array of cluster types that ‘self-organize’, the synoptic categories in the array effectively represent a continuum of synoptic categorizations, compared with discrete realizations produced through most traditional methods. Thus, a larger number of patterns can be more readily understood, and patterns, as well as transitional nodes between patterns, can be discerned. Perhaps the most intriguing development with SOMs has been the new avenues of visualization; the resultant spatial patterns of any variable can be more readily understood when displayed in a SOM. This improved visualization has led to SOMs becoming an increasingly popular tool in various research with climatological applications from other disciplines as well.},

The general circulation is thus considered to consist of the flow averaged in time over a period sufficiently long to remove the random variations associated with individual weather systems but short enough to retain monthly and seasonal variations. This chapter focuses on the influence of eddies on the structure of the zonal-mean circulation and discusses the angular momentum and energy budgets of the zonally averaged flow.

Several characteristics of blocking anticyclones were included in the study and these were frequency of occurrence, preferred formation regions, duration, blocking days, and intensity. The block intensity (BI) calculation was modified successfully from a previous study in order to automate the procedure for use with large datasets, and it is applied for the first time to derive a long-term observational record of this quantity. This modification also makes BI suitable for use as a diagnostic tool. Blocking events in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere were the most persistent and strongest during the cold season and over the Atlantic (Pacific) region, as found using BI to measure intensity. The characteristics of blocking events derived in this study were compared to previous long-term climatological studies and across each hemisphere. It was found that the temporal and spatial distributions in both hemispheres were similar to those of longer-term studies. The interannual variability of blocking was also examined with respect to ENSO-related variability for the entire blocking year. It was found that Northern (Southern) Hemisphere blocking events were stronger and more frequent during La Ni\~{n}a (El Ni\~{n}o) years, a result that is consistent with cyclone variability in each hemisphere.

abstract = {During the 20th century and early 21st century, the subtropical ridge (STR) in the vicinity of eastern Australia has intensified significantly. While the position of the STR has often been the focus of past studies, its influence on rainfall across southern Australia is less pronounced than the influence of the intensity of the ridge. Most of the Australian continent has experienced above average rainfall from 1997 to 2009, but areas of below average rainfall, including southeastern Australia (SEA), exist and tend to match the pattern of the influence of the STR on Australian rainfall. The spatial extent makes the 1997–2009 rainfall deficit in SEA different from previous dry decades such as 1935–1945. It is also noted that the annual cycle of the rainfall deficiency centred on a continuum from March to October overlaps well with the time of the year when the STR intensity has a strong influence on rainfall. Using simple linear statistics, a rainfall decline for the period 1997–2009 equivalent to nearly two thirds of that observed can be inferred from the intensification of the ridge. The apparent southward shift of the ridge in certain seasons does not appear to have had an additional effect on SEA rainfall. During the 1935–1945 drought, almost a third of the rainfall decline can be attributed to the strengthening of the ridge. Finally, it was observed that the intensification of the STR was not monotonic during the 20th century but happened mostly during two extended periods: from 1900 to the 1940s, culminating at the time of the 1935–1945 dry decade, and from 1970 to 2010 culminating with the 1997–2009 rainfall deficit in SEA. That multidecadal behaviour is reminiscent of the global warming of the planet.},

abstract = {Worldwide interest in the deployment of photovoltaic generation (PV) is rapidly increasing. Operating experience with large PV plants, however, demonstrates that large, rapid changes in the output of PV plants are possible. Early studies of PV grid impacts suggested that short-term variability could be a potential limiting factor in deploying PV. Many of these early studies, however, lacked high-quality data from multiple sites to assess the costs and impacts of increasing PV penetration. As is well known for wind, accounting for the po- tential for geographic diversity can significantly reduce the magnitude of extreme changes in aggregated PV output, the resources required to accommodate that variability, and the potential costs of managing variability. We use measured 1-min solar insolation for 23 time- synchronized sites in the Southern Great Plains network of the Atmospheric Radiation Mea- surement program and wind speed data from 10 sites in the same network to characterize the variability of PV with different degrees of geographic diversity and to compare the variabil- ity of PV to the variability of similarly sited wind. The relative aggregate variability of PV plants sited in a dense 10 10 array with 20 km spacing is six times less than the variability of a single site for variability on time scales less than 15-min. We find in our analysis of PV and wind plants similarly sited in a 5 5 grid with 50 km spacing that the variability of PV is only slightly more than the variability of wind on time scales of 5-15 min. Over shorter and longer time scales the level of variability is nearly identical. Finally, we use a simple approximation method to estimate the cost of carrying additional reserves to manage sub-hourly variability. We conclude that the costs of managing the short-term variability of PV are dramatically reduced by geographic diversity and are not substantially different from the costs for managing the short-term variability of similarly sited wind in this region.},

abstract = {The spatial and temporal distribution of the downward solar radiation (DSR) at the Earth's surface, which is a key parameter for the Earth-atmosphere climate system, is studied on a global scale by applying the multivariate statistical method of factor analysis (FA) on mean monthly DSR values for the period 1984-2000 for winter and summer. DSR fluxes have been computed with a physical deterministic radiation transfer model, which uses satellite and reanalysis climatological input data. FA objectively groups grid points with common temporal variability of solar radiation, identifying areas with characteristic solar radiation variability and revealing teleconnection patterns. The globally distributed DSR exhibits strong variability and can be represented by about 30 factors (sub-areas) explaining approximately 85\% of the total variance. The main factors are located in the tropical Pacific (El Nino Southern Oscillation), the northern Pacific (Aleutian low), desert areas (Africa, Middle East, and Australia), and oceanic areas (storm track zone around 60 S). Furthermore, some of these areas are teleconnected indicating common DSR variability in remote places of the Earth. The primary physical parameter for the co-variability of surface solar radiation is found to be cloud cover. The time series of the factor scores (solar radiation) exhibit features associated with natural climatic phenomena (e. g. NAO, ENSO), thus revealing that DSR might be considered as an indirect indicator for these phenomena. On the other hand, DSR determines these phenomena through its effects on major climate parameters such as surface temperature or evaporation, thus playing a key role in their formation and explanation. Finally, our analysis revealed some statistically significant trends of solar radiation, for example, a reduction in the northern Pacific and an increase in tropical and subtropical regions, which are important for global dimming/brightening and associated surface warming of the Earth.

@article{Trenberth2011,
abstract = {An assessment is made of the global energy and hydrological cycles from eight current atmospheric reanalyses and their depiction of changes over time. A brief evaluation of the water and energy cycles in the latest version of the NCAR climate model referred to as CCSM4 is also given. The focus is on the mean ocean, land, and global precipitation P; the corresponding evaporation E; their difference corresponding to the surface freshwater flux E–P; and the vertically integrated atmospheric moisture transports. Using the model-based P and E, the time- and area-average E–P for the oceans, P–E for land, and the moisture transport from ocean to land should all be identical but are not close in most reanalyses, and often differ significantly from observational estimates of the surface return flow based on net river discharge into the oceans. Their differences reveal outstanding issues with atmospheric models and their biases, which are manifested as analysis increments in the reanalyses. The NCAR CCSM4, along with most reanalysis models, the exception being MERRA, has too-intense water cycling (P and E) over the ocean although ocean-to-land transports are very close to observed. Precipitation from reanalyses that assimilate moisture from satellite observations exhibits large changes identified with the changes in the observing system, as new and improved temperature and water vapor channels are assimilated and, while P improves after about 2002, E–P does not. Discrepancies among hydrological cycle components arise from analysis increments that can add or subtract moisture. The large-scale moisture budget divergences are more stable in time and similar across reanalyses than model-based estimates of E–P. Results are consistent with the view that recycling of moisture is too large in most models and the lifetime of moisture is too short. For the energy cycle, most reanalyses have spurious imbalances of \~{}10 W m−2 within the atmosphere, and \~{}5–10 W m−2 in net fluxes into the surface and to space. Major improvements are needed in model treatment and assimilation of moisture, and surface fluxes from reanalyses should only be used with great caution.},

abstract = {Both high-latitude (HLM) and low-latitude modes (LLM) of variability of zonal wind in the Southern Hemisphere have been identified. Through an analysis of simulation for 1871-2200 by the CSIRO Mark 3 climate model, the extent to which these might both be described as "annular modes," based oil their statistical patterns. physical mechanisms. and usefulness in climate study, is assessed. The modes are determined as EOF1 and EOF2 of vertically integrated zonal and monthly mean zonal wind, for 1871-1970. These match well those from ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA) data and also from the earlier Mark 2 model. The mode index time series relate to largely annular patterns of local wind and surface pressure anomalies [with HUM giving the familiar southern annular mode (SAM)]. and other simulated quantities. While modes calculated from 90 degrees sectors are only moderately correlated (mostly in the polar region) for HLM, the link increases with time scale. There is little such relationship for LLM. A momentum equation analysis using daily data confirms that both zonal modes are driven by eddies, but only HLM features a positive eddy-mean flow feedback. Variation in feedback and surface damping through the seasonal cycle relate well to that in index autocorrelation. with the HLM being more persistent in summer. Stratospheric winds feature a long-lived component that tends to lead the FILM. The FILM drives sea surface temperature anomalies that persist for months, and Coupling with the ocean increases variability on longer time scales. The annular variability in the warmer climate of the twenty-second century is barely changed, but the mean climate change in the far south projects strongly on the HLM. The LLM features some statistical annularity and may have Some uses. However, only the HLM can be considered to be a physically based mode-the zonal-wind equivalent to the one southern annular mode.},

abstract = {Changes in atmospheric circulation over Europe since 1958 were examined using both objective (modes of low-frequency variability and objective classification of circulation types) and subjective (Hess-Brezowsky classification of weather types) methods. The analysis was performed with an emphasis on the differences between the winter (DJF) and summer (JJA) seasons, and between objectively and subjectively based results. Majority of the most important changes in atmospheric circulation are same or similar for the objective and subjective methods: they include the strengthening of the zonal flow in winter since the 1960s to the early 1990s; the increase (decrease) in frequency of anticyclonic (cyclonic) types in winter from the late 1960s to the early 1990s, with a subsequent decline (rise); and the sharp increase in the persistence (measured by the mean residence time) of all groups of circulation types in winter around 1990 and of anticyclonic types in summer during the 1990s. Differences between the findings obtained using the objective and subjective methods may result from the intrinsically different approach to the classification (e.g. the Hess-Brezowsky weather types have a typical duration of at least 3 days while objective types typically last 1-3 days). Generally, changes in atmospheric circulation which have taken place since the 1960s were more pronounced in winter than in summer. The most conspicuous change seems to be the considerable increase in the persistence of circulation types during the 1990s, which may be also reflected in the increase in the occurrence of climatic extremes observed in Europe during recent years.},

The goal of this study is to evaluate three common clustering techniques (Ward's, average linkage, and centroid) to determine which yields the most meaningful synoptic classification. The three clustering procedures were applied to a temporal synoptic index which classified days in Mobile, Alabama into meteorologically homogeneous units. The final meteorological groupings differed widely among the three pressures. Ward's tended to produce groups with relatively similar numbers of days. Thus, many extreme weather days were grouped with less extreme days, and the final meteorological units did not duplicate reality with great precision. The centroid procedure produced one very large group and many single-day groups, yielding unsatisfactory results. The average linkage procedure, which minimizes within-cluster variance, produced the most realistic synoptic groupings and properly combined extreme weather days into distinct meteorological units.},

abstract = {The main goal of this study is a comparison of two different methods of pattern recognition. The first, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is a method frequently used in climatology. The second, Self Organizing Maps (SOM), is a relatively new and efficient method based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). In order to compare the two methodologies, two teleconnection patterns were chosen, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which mostly affects the climate of Western Europe, and the North Sea-Caspian Pattern (NCP), mainly affecting eastern Mediterranean and the Balkan Peninsula. The teleconnection patterns are studied for winter 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies over the broader Europe area. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the ECHAM5/MPI General Circulation Model (GCM) in representing the two teleconnection patterns for a reference (1971-2000) and a future (2071-2100) period. The evaluation of the reference period is done comparing the simulated data to the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. The future period is studied to examine whether the current dominant circulation patterns change or not during the last 30 years of the 21st century. According to the results, both PCA and SOM methodologies capture the main variability mode over the study area, represented by the NAO pattern, but SOM is capable of capturing even less pronounced patterns, such as the NCP. In the future simulations, the atmospheric circulation during winter seems to be more pronounced with stronger NAO and NCP teleconnection patterns. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Because of the pressing need for maintaining a healthy environment with reasonable costs, China is moving toward the trend for generating electricity from renewable resources. Both solar energy and wind power have received a tremendous attention from private associations, political groups, and electric power companies to generate power on a large scale. A drawback is their unpredictable nature and dependence on weather. Fortunately, the problems can be partially tackled by using the strengths of one source to overcome the weakness of the other. Especially, a large fraction of the solar resource is available at times of peak electrical load. However, the complexity of using two different resources together makes the hybrid solar-wind generation systems more difficult to analyze. Accordingly, this paper first briefly introduces the solar-wind generation system and next develops its critical success criteria. Then, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process associated with benefits, opportunities, costs and risks, is proposed to help select a suitable solar-wind power generation project. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
