\begin_layout Chapter
Concluding Remarks and Recomendations for Future Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis is aimed at establishing a better understanding of tropical
 cyclone (TC) characteristics in the Fiji, Samoa and Tonga regions (the
 FST region) during different phases of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
 phenomenon and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) – the two major modes
 of natural climate variability in the tropical Pacific.
 Results derived are then used to formulate sophisticated statistical forecast
 models to provide forewarning of tropical cyclone strike in the FST region
 up to three months prior to a cyclone season.
 A new methodology for predicting the probablistic potential of any existing
 tropical depression in the region to undergo further development into a
 tropical cyclone is also developed.
 In this chapter, we first summarize what we have done in this thesis and
 then present areas that can potentially form the work of future investigations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major findings associated with research priorities highlighted in the
 first chapter are summarized as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Tropical cyclone genesis positions and tracks in the FST region exhibit
 a marked interannual variability due to the ENSO phenomenon.
 During the El Niño phase, for example, TC genesis is enhanced east of the
 dateline, extending from north of Fiji to over Samoa.
 The TCs formed during El Niño years take three characteristic paths depending
 on their mean genesis locations.
 In the La Niña phase, fewer TCs are observed compared to the El Niño phase
 and genesis is more common in the west of the region to about 170°E.
 The TCs formed during La Niña years are often steered over the Fiji islands
 and Tonga from the Coral Sea region with relatively little or no threat
 to Samoa.
 Such variations seen in the ENSO-TC relationship over the FST region are
 linked to concomitant changes in the large-scale environmental conditions
 such as low-level relative vorticity, upper-level divergence and environmental
 vertical wind shear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In addition to TC genesis position and tracks, understanding TC intensity
 variability due to ENSO is also important.
 Intensity variability here is inferred from the accumulated cyclone energy
 (ACE).
 Overall, results suggest that ACE in the FST region is considerably influenced
 by the ENSO signal.
 A substantial contribution to this ENSO signal in ACE comes from the region
 equatorward of 15°S where TC numbers, lifetime and intensity all play a
 significant role.
 However, the ACE-ENSO relationship weakens substantially poleward of 15°S
 where large-scale environmental variables affecting TC intensity are found
 to be less favourable in El Niño years than in La Niña years; in the region
 equatorward of 15°S, the reverse is true.
 It is found that TCs entering this region poleward of 15°S are able to
 sustain their intensity for a longer period of time in La Niña years as
 opposed to TCs entering the region in El Niño years, when they decay more
 rapidly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The modulation of TC activity in the FST region by the MJO is also investigated.
 Results suggest strong MJO-TC relationships in the FST region.
 TC genesis patterns are significantly altered over the FST region with
 approximately five times more cyclones forming in the active phase than
 in the inactive phase of the MJO.
 This modulation is further strengthened during El Niño periods.
 The large-scale environmental conditions (i.e., low-level relative vorticity,
 upper-level divergence and vertical wind shear) associated with TC genesis
 show a distinct pattern of variability for the active and inactive MJO
 phases.
 The MJO also has a significant effect on hurricane category and combined
 gale and storm category cyclones in the FST region.
 TC tracks also show distinct patterns in different MJO phases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Cyclones in the FST region exhibit a marked year-to-year variability due
 to the ENSO phenomenon.
 This ENSO-TC relationship is identifiable prior to a cyclone season through
 the use of appropriate ENSO indices, thus making it possible to predict
 TC strike well in advance.
 Two separate Poisson models are developed using Bayesian processes to predict
 TC counts in the FST region for the upcoming cyclone season: (i) for cyclones
 forming within the FST region (FORM) and (ii) for cyclones entering the
 FST region (ENT).
 Predictors examined include various ENSO indices and large–scale environmental
 parameters.
 Significant preseason correlations are found as early as May-July (about
 three months in advance).
 Therefore, May-July predictors are used to make initial predictions and
 updated predictions are issued later using October-December early cyclone
 season predictors.
 These models have substantial skill in predicting TC counts over the FST
 region, particularly for years associated with El Niño and La Niña conditions.
 However, no significant skill can be achieved with these models for ENSO-neutra
l conditions where the model performance is quite variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In order to improve predictions for TC activity over the FST region for
 ENSO-neutral years, a simple methodology describing the development of
 a binary classification model for the prediction of high and low TC activity
 in the FST region is developed.
 Results clearly suggest that this model predicts cyclone activity over
 the FST region with substantial skill during the May-July preseason for
 all years considered in the analysis – considerable improvement is achieved
 for ENSO neutral years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As in other cyclone basins, a number of tropical disturbances form each
 year in the FST region and only a few develop further into TCs.
 Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the way in which a tropical
 disturbance first becomes a tropical depression and then undergoes further
 development into a tropical cyclone.
 Here some major differences are found in large-scale environmental conditions
 between those depression that eventually develop into TCs and those that
 do not.
 Consequently, a statistical model is developed using these large-scale
 environmental conditions as predictors to forecast the probabilistic potential
 of a tropical depression to develop further into a tropical cyclone.
 Results suggest some potential for these models in successfully predicting
 depressions that are likely to undergo further development into TCs up
 to 72 hours in advance.

In addition, we have uncovered potential areas for some further work.
 These include, but are not limited to, the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Various forecast models developed here are purely statistical in nature
 and they use large-scale environmental conditions as predictors.
 It may be interesting to compare the skill of these models with that from
 the dynamical models such as European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
 (ECMWF) system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Our investigation is confined only to the FST region.
 Extending the work to the entire southwest tropical Pacific (SWTP) region
 could form potential future work, in particular developing the prediction
 schemes for the entire SWTP region.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Events related to the recently-termed El Niño Modoki (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Ashok_et_al_2007"

\end_inset

) have become more frequent over the past few decades than traditional El
 Niño examined here.
 The Modoki El Niño is characterized by warm SST anomalies in the central
 Pacific straddled by cold anomalies to either side.
 How this phenomenon modulates TC activity is unexplored in this thesis.
 Therefore, it will be worthwhile in future work to examine the effect of
 Modoki El Niño on tropical cyclone formation and tracks in the central
 south Pacific region, which also spans the FST region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One focus of this thesis has been on understanding tropical cyclone characterist
ics over the FST region in the present climate.
 How these characteristics are going to change in the future climate as
 a result of global warming is an important area that can be explored using
 numerical prediction models.

In summary, this project provides a complete and thorough understanding
 of TC variability (both at intraseasonal and interannual time domain) in
 the FST region.
 It adds to the broad body of scientific literature, which is otherwise
 limited for the FST region on various aspects of TC characteristics.
 It is also of a significant national benefit by providing a better understandin
g of TC behavior through its contribution to the improvement of TC forecasting
 schemes.
 This may result in significant economic and social benefits in the form
 of more effective and coordinated preparation for cyclone events.
