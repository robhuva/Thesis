, this chapter aims to balance the competing needs of reducing the reliance
 of fossil fuels in the electricity sector and managing the demand for electrici

 Unlike

, which focused on the state of Victoria, the current study first encompasses
 all of Australia and then most of the eastern and southern Australian states
 (the participating states of the NEM).
 The optimal placement of renewable resources and the output of the system
 as a whole will both give an indication of the large-scale interaction
 of the wind and solar fields over Australia.
 The optimised placement of resources will indicate separation distances
 for resource diversity and balancing of output across the whole two years,
 while the analysis of the output from the optimised system will reveal
 particular weather phenomena that are likely to be important for system
 maintenance in the future.

 The resulting time series of wind plus solar, gas and hydro is shown in
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 As can be seen there is a high reliance on wind power and there are many
 days where total output exceeds demand by as much as 30-40%.
 The largest wind station has an installed capacity of 12GW and the largest
 solar station 23GW, which in total have an installed capacity much greater
 than the average Australia-wide demand for electricity.

 is the use of very remote locations in Western Australia (WA).
 It is concluded that these locations in WA have very complementary resources---
and thus minimise the gas usage in the model (cost effective given the high
 costs of gas).
 Interesting to note, however, is the reliance on only one solar station
 (near Darwin).
 This location is part of a region in north-west Australia that has the
 highest annual solar irradiance of all Australian locations (as seen earlier
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 there is evidently no advantage for the

 at night and the lack of diversity in resource indicates its large-scale
 use without storage could be limited in the future.
 Analysis not presented in the thesis showed that no realistic level of
 penalty could be employed to eliminate the use of remote Western Australian
 locations.
 This result, while less informative for the future design of Australia’s
 RE capacities (due to the vast distances from important load centres),
 is potentially very instructive for the resource assessment of Australia.
 That is, when given the opportunity to install renewable capacity across
 Australia the

 model chooses to use many remote Western Australian locations for renewable
 capacity.
 Consequently, any future scenarios that limit the site selection to eastern
 Australia will have to rely on less diverse and less effective locations.
 The next section explores the implications of this finding by limiting

 It is assumed that limiting available sites to the south and east will
 produce a more realistic map of installed capacities for Australia, thus
 making later conclusions surrounding moments of low wind and solar and
 the most influential synoptic weather regimes, more realistic.

 Thus the same minimum distance and land availability restraints introduced

Mapping between ACCESS and ERA-Interim

\begin_layout Standard
An important step for later analysis was the identification of synoptic
 regimes as they occurred in 2010-2011.
 Part 2 identifies the occurrence of 30 synoptic weather regimes by utilising
 the results from Part 1---the 30-node SOM that was created from ERA-Interim
 MSLP data.
 It was necessary to assign all ACCESS-A time steps with a SOM node from
 Part 1 in order to form relationships between moments of low output from
 the ACCESS-optimised network and the large-scale weather regimes that co-occur.
 A fundamental component of this thesis is the influence of synoptic scale
 variability on RE output.
 The SOM nodes represent common synoptic scale conditions and provide the
 link between synoptic scale variance and RE output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to utilise the Part 1 SOM, ERA-Interim data for 2010-2011 was obtained.
 The assigning of SOM nodes to 2010-2011 ERA-Interim data occurred as per
 Part 1 whereby the closest matching SOM node (the Best Matching Unit (BMU))
 was assigned to each ERA-Interim time step in 2010-2011.
 A filtering process was also undertaken to eliminate time steps that had
 ambiguous relationships to the SOM.
 The level of filtering used in Part 2 involved the elimination of BMUs
 that had a single-point discrepancy of more than 20hPa, a further elimination
 of the worst 5% of remaining BMU and a final checking procedure with a
 4hPa exceedance threshold (refer to Section.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Filtering-the-Mapping"

\end_inset

 for a detailed description of these filtering measures).
 The filtering process with the 2010-2011 ERA-Interim data eliminated just
 over 6% of matches.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following this, the mapping from ERA-Interim temporal resolution, which
 is six-hourly, to ACCESS temporal resolution, which is hourly (and also
 incomplete), was necessary.
 The mapping allows for the assignment of a SOM node from the list of filtered
 BMU to each available ACCESS-A time step.
 The process of matching hourly resolution data to six-hourly resolution
 data was undertaken by simply allocating blocks of six hours from ACCESS-A
 that were centred on an ERA-Interim time step (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ERA-ACCESS-TS-Map"

\end_inset

 for a graphical example).
 Given that within any block of six ACCESS-A time steps there is only one
 hour that matches exactly the hour of the ERA-Interim time step some unevenness
 in the six-hour block was inevitable.
 The decision was made to implement a ‘forward-leaning’ approach.
 The forward leaning approach involved assigning the previous two hours,
 the hour that matched the ERA-Interim time step and the next three hours
 from ACCESS-space to each ERA-interim time step.

 What is clear from Fig.

 is the increase in oversupply from the renewables when compared to the

 This was not unexpected given the similarity in technology costs between
 the two simulations and the greater diversity in resources available in
 the whole-country simulation.

 What is also clear from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:NEM-Only-Installed-Cap"

\end_inset

 is the choice of some remote locations in spite of the extra transmission
 cost of connecting these sites.
 The largest wind site (17.3GW in northern Queensland) is a long distance
 from the nearest capital city (Brisbane) and the largest solar installation
 (5.4GW in south-west Queensland) is also quite a distance from the nearest
 capital city (Brisbane).
 Thus there still appears to be a tendency by the GA to prefer locations
 with decent/complementary resources over those that might be closer to
 a capital city, but whose resources are not as optimal.
 This could indicate a connection cost that is too inexpensive or alternatively
 a resource that is far superior to alternative locations.
 The answer to this question is addressed in later sections where the connection
 cost is increased (see sections

 (low RE) output.
 The identification of a low RE event is described in the following process:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Any ACCESS-A time step that had a combined RE output that was more than
 20% below demand was said to be a low RE time step.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An event was deemed to be a collection of consecutive low RE time steps.
 Except where: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The next low RE time step is within six hours of the previous low RE time
 step 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OR 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A time step is within six hours of the nearest low RE time step and only
 just failed the original criterion of being more than 20% below demand.
 The definition of only just failing was deemed to be a time step where
 the combined RE output was more than 15% below demand.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The 20% below threshold was relaxed to 15% in the above in order to increase
 the continuity of events.
 20% below demand was seen as an appropriate figure, but should (for example)
 a time step only just fail this criterion and was a critical time step
 for continuing a new event or not, it should be included.
 This process could be seen as similar to smoothing the time series of low
 RE by applying a running mean and then only including smoothed time steps
 below the original 80% of demand criterion.
 The approach presented here is also similar to that undertaken by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in their simulation of 100% RE for the NEM.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The definition of the most challenging week in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 was that which used the most gas back-up.
 AEMO's definition is intuitively similar to that outline above given that
 the moments of low RE output would also correlate well with increased gas
 usage to cover the gaps in RE---although modulated depending on the state
 of the hydro reserves.
 Once the low RE time steps and events from the NEM-only simulation were
 identified the next step was to analyse their relationship to the large-scale
 synoptic weather patterns.

 The occurrence of SOM nodes in time was randomised in order to assess the

In particular, there are some SOM nodes that appear to never co-occur with
 very low RE for the NEM-only simulation.
 Nodes six and 25 significantly never co-occur with the lowest RE output.
 However, of more interest are perhaps those nodes that are significantly
 associated with very low RE output.
 For instance, there is a region of the SOM (nodes eight, nine, 10, 15)
 that represents almost half of all of the very low RE time steps.
 Given the smooth nature of the SOM these nodes represent similar MSLP distribut
ions and therefore represent a sub-set of similar synoptic regimes from

In fact, the map of node nine in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows relatively weak pressure gradients over most of the Australian domain---m
ost of which are significant features.
 The weak pressure gradients could be an artifact of the averaging process
 undertaken when producing the composite.
 However, short of showing each member of the composite or a figure of the
 standard deviation at each point, the associated average 80m wind speed
 is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Node9-LowRE-U80-Composite"

\end_inset

---it was expected that given the relationship between large-scale pressure
 and the geostrophic wind there might also be weak wind speeds associated
 with the very low RE occurrences of node nine.
 As is seen in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Node9-LowRE-U80-Composite"

\end_inset

 there are indeed very weak average wind speeds across most of the eastern
 part of Australia during very low RE node nine.
 The availability of wind speeds above the cut-in of 3m/s is remarkably
 low.
 In an average sense it would actually be expected that an occurrence of
 very low RE node nine might produce almost no power across eastern Australia.
 This is significant given the positioning of resources for the NEM-only
 simulation.
 It appears as if the low pressure gradients associated with node nine,
 and in particular very low RE node nine, are quite detrimental for the
 optimised resources from the NEM-only simulation.
 The emphasis here being that the resources allocated by the

energy
\change_inserted -1458100629 1418779690

 model are optimised.
 Thus there appears to be no net advantage in the model avoiding this type
 of stilling weather pattern---the very low RE node nine is likely not a
 significant enough portion of the hours in 2010-2011 to warrant changing
 the resource allocation to accommodate it.

 As can be seen from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 there is actually no real bias suggesting node nine is particularly detrimental
, even on average.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the skewness of RE - demand for node nine is almost zero and the
 mean and median are also in close association.
 In this instance the predictive power of node nine is limited.
 The spread of possible values seen in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Node9-RE-Demand-Histogram"

\end_inset

 suggests that the variance around node nine is large and both extremes
 (oversupply and undersupply) are possible.
 The importance of node nine is the occurrence of the very low output potential,
 which is identified by the version of node nine seen in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 with very low pressure gradients.
 Thus the conclusions for node nine are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The association with very low RE is significant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Node nine has the potential to be detrimental to wind power for nearly the
 entire NEM region
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However node nine is not always associated with very low RE---node nine
 is also associated with oversupply.
 Oversupply of RE also involves the relative production of solar and wind.
 For instance, solar is less directly influenced by MSLP gradients, indicating
 that weak pressure gradients from node nine could also lead to RE oversupply.

Nearly all of the domain for the composite of very low RE node 30 is significant
ly different to the long-term MSLP.
 Node 30 could be considered as a continental heat low, which also occur
 in summertime (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Sturman2005"

\end_inset

).
 Continental heat lows form as a result of convection that is triggered
 by heating of the continent---hence the association with summer.
 The low pressure centred over WA represents a break between successive
 high pressure systems, which are visible in the eastern and western edges
 of the domain (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Node30-Low-RE-MSLP-Composite"

\end_inset

).
 Node 30, as per node nine, is also characterised by low pressure gradients
 across the Austral domain.
 In fact, the pressure gradients for very low RE node 30 are actually weaker
 than that seen for very low RE node nine.
 Again, this results in, on average, large-scale stilling over the NEM region
 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Node30-LowRE-U80-Composite"

\end_inset

).
 The weak 80m wind speeds seen for very low RE node 30 appear to be quite
 similar to node nine---in spite of any difference in weather type and MSLP
 distribution.
 For very low RE node 30 there is limited access to average wind speeds
 above about 5 ms

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, which shows the allocation of resources for the NEM-only simulation, had
 the largest installation of wind speed in northern Queensland.
 This region, for both very low RE node nine and node 30, is particularly
 subject to average wind speeds less than the cut-in.
 It is concluded that this is why these occurrences of nodes nine and 30
 are identified as very low RE.
 However, an important point to make is that Figs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Node30-LowRE-U80-Composite"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Node9-LowRE-U80-Composite"

\end_inset

 show no realistic alternative (in terms of a location that could avoid
 the stilling).
 One might also argue that these significant node-low RE associations are
 of no concern because the NEM-only simulation is not realistic/comprehensive
 enough and would therefore never be implemented.
 What this argument misses, however, is the fact that the low wind speeds
 seen in Figs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Node30-LowRE-U80-Composite"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Node9-LowRE-U80-Composite"

\end_inset

 would be detrimental for almost any arrangement of resources across the
 NEM.
 Thus, if a somewhat simplistic, or ‘best-case scenario’ simulation---like
 that of the NEM-only simulation---fails to accommodate these stilling synoptic
 regimes than surely a more sophisticated simulation (that would also be
 more limited in its choices for resource allocation) would also perform
 poorly under these conditions, as well as others.

The distribution of RE - demand for all occurrences of node 30 shows more
 of a significant bias towards very low RE than node nine with a median
 of -1.4GW and a mean of 0GW, but again no conclusion that node 30 is significant
ly more associated, on the whole, with very low RE than high (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 However, when analysing similar distributions for all nodes it becomes
 clear that there are some nodes (seen as significantly un-associated with
 very low RE in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) that have a bias on the whole towards very high RE output (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:All-Nodes-RE-Demand-Hist"

\end_inset

).
 For instance, nodes six and 25 were seen as never occurring with very low
 RE for the NEM-only simulation.
 These nodes also have a mean over-supply (when considering all occurrences
 from the two years) of about 14.5GW and very limited occurrences of under-supply.
 Other nodes that were also significantly un-associated, but in a non-zero
 sense, with very low RE output have very high means in terms of oversupply
 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 These nodes include node 19 (mean of 13.9GW) and node four (mean of 9.5GW).
 While oversupply is more manageable for an RE-based

 RE events is presented---extended periods of very low RE output (see section

 for the definition of a low RE event).
 An important consideration for a future highly RE dependent Australia would
 be the time wise behaviour of very low RE output.
 Characteristics that include average duration and average return period
 are important for stability in output and the potential of black-outs in
 supply.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "AEMO2013"

\end_inset

 in their study of 100% RE in the NEM noted that managing consecutive days
 of low wind and solar output was much more challenging than managing isolated
 days of low RE output.
 What the very low RE event investigation also provides is the opportunity
 to analyse whether or not specific weather regimes re-occur or persist
 during very low RE events.

 simulation.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Low-RE-Event-Length-Histogram"

\end_inset

 illustrates that there is a large positive skewness in the event duration
 as well as a separation between mean and median.
 The distribution of event lengths suggests that events longer than about
 10 hours are quite rare---the median is four hours.
 However, given the reliability standards of today’s NEM (99.998% of hours
 met) any event longer than 10 hours would likely pose significant issues---part
icularly at peak times.
 It is clear that the distribution is skewed by some extreme events that
 last for, in the worst case, 52 hours.
 This is not to suggest that there was no power available to the NEM for
 in excess of two days---the definition of an event is a collection of days
 where the RE output is more than 20% below demand---but it does suggest
 that there is limited supply in some instances for prolonged periods.
 In fact, the hydro reserves would likely run out during the 52 hour event
 and the system would then have to rely on expensive gas back-up to meet
 demand (during the 52 hour event gas peaks at 12.7GW and operates at a capacity
 factor of 22%).

 The distribution of return period lengths is more skewed than the event

 the mean and median; indicating that the return period distribution is
 even more heavily influenced by extrema.
 In the case of a return period distribution, however, a large return period
 would be considered positive for the

 system to manage the next moment of low RE output is aided by a longer
 return period with increased pumped hydro reservoir levels.
 The median return period for a very low RE event is close to two days at
 45 hours (due to the relatively more common return periods of about two
 days or less) while the average is closer to seven days (171.8 hours).
 The analysis of return periods suggests that the NEM-only system does in
 fact have periods during the two years that have relatively high reliability
 from RE.
 That is, there are some events that are separated by in excess of 20 days
 and even one instance where the system went over 116 days without having
 extended very low RE.
 While oversupply might be inevitable for an RE-based electricity system,
 oversupply will always be less of an issue than under-supply.
 Oversupply is an issue that can be dealt with by a range of solutions---includi
ng curtailment, load shifting and electric car charging, or other types
 of storage (like that explored in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Under-supply, however, has no such easy solution because it is not possible
 to simply ramp-up a wind turbine or solar installation when the wind is
 low or the sun is not shining.

 shows the persistence or transitioning of SOM nodes from within the very
 low RE events of the NEM-only simulation.
 Persistence is considered to be an important characteristic for the identificat
ion of synoptic regimes that are linked to very low RE output.
 The persistence of a weather type within a very low RE event could indicate
 a bias.
 Such a biases are not indentifiable using statistics, including the Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Low-RE-SOM-Percentage-Plot"

\end_inset

 average plots, which aggregate across all low RE events.
 The definition of a transition requires that the transition (persistence)
 be made within the same very low RE event and that the transition (persistence)
 occur to a new (the same) SOM node in six-hourly ERA-Interim space.
 For instance, the persistence on a node is not considered to occur in ACCESS-A
 space if there is no transition made from hour to hour---a transition,
 or not, can only occur across the six-hourly blocks, and, can only be to
 a SOM node occurrence that was not filtered out.
 As can be seen from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Low-RE-SOM-Transition-Plot"

\end_inset

 there is a lot of persistence or transitions that occur to neighbouring
 nodes from within the very low RE events.
 The banding in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Low-RE-SOM-Transition-Plot"

\end_inset

 that is approximately six nodes apart indicates a transition down/up the
 SOM space, rather than across, and is due to the smooth nature of the SOM.
 Neighbouring SOM nodes are, by definition, closely related to each other
 and thus a transition to a neighbour is by design more likely.
 What is also seen in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 is that nodes nine
\change_inserted -1458100629 1418361600

\change_unchanged
 and 30
\change_inserted -1458100629 1418361615

 are some of the most persistent.
 These nodes were seen as being significantly

\change_unchanged
 associated with very low RE output and Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 during an event.

 Fig.

 any of the SOM nodes.
 This indicates that node 30 is in general a slow moving synoptic regime---givin
g an explanation for its persistence during very low RE events as well.
 Node nine is, however, the most persistent node during very low RE events.
 Yet the persistence of node nine in general is not as marked as node 30.
 Thus the southerly high pressure centre outline in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for node nine has a tendency, at times, of being more persistent.

very low RE output.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 suggests this region (nodes eight, nine, 10, and 15) is not particularly
 persistent on the whole, but that its persistence is among the highest
 during very low RE events (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Low-RE-SOM-Transition-Plot"

).
 Thus the southerly high seen for node nine can not only persist for longer
 than average but also transition to neighbouring nodes during a very low

a there is a significant tendency for node 25 to be associated with oversupply.

 This is easy to understand when Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Node 25 has on average 14GW of oversupply when it occurs, while moments
 where demand is higher than RE for node 25 are very limited.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

b shows a very similar story of oversupply for node six.
 On average node six is associated with 14.4GW of oversupply, and although
 node six is less common than node 25, it still shows a very clear bias
 towards oversupply.
 Only 16 time steps are moments of RE below demand for node six.

 Node six is associated with low pressure centred south of Adelaide and
 an associated front directing cold air to parts of South Australia and
 Victoria.
 Relatively higher pressure gradients also indicate that node six would
 be associated with increased wind speeds along the coast of South Australia,
 much of Victoria and coastal regions of NSW.

While node 25 is less associated with low pressure and cold air it is associated
 with higher pressure gradients through much of the same regions as node
 six.
 The higher wind speeds are important given the reliance on wind power in
 the NEM-only simulation.
 In particular, the regions with installed capacity of wind would benefit
 greatly from the occurrence of nodes 25 and six.
 This benefit is apparent not only in the MSLP plots, but also the oversupply
 plots shown earlier.

 A prediction of nodes nine or 30, however does not guarantee very low RE
 as 9.1% of node nine and 6.5% of node 30 occurrences were associated with
 very low RE.
 Alternatively, it was shown that a prediction of nodes 25 and six is far
 more likely than not to produce conditions that result in oversupply of
 wind power in the NEM region.

) regarding the performance of the NEM-Only simulation that are season-specific
 can be addressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both the summer-only and winter-only simulations the optimisation is
 conducted in the same manner as the NEM-Only simulation (same costs, cost
 function formulation, available resource types, etc.) but with only the
 data from the 2010-2011 period that fall into that particular season.
 Splicing of the data from year to year is conducted such that, in the case
 of winter-only, the end of August of 2010 is followed by the start of June
 in 2011.
 Gas costing is also altered slightly in the season specific simulations.
 The gas cost structure introduced in the NEM-Only simulation had a penalty
 applied to the fuel costs, which are small for a two-year simulation but
 would be much larger over the lifetime of the gas plant.
 This penalty is increased for the winter and summer only simulations because
 they are shorter than the two-year NEM-only simulation.

Solar PV is not utilised in the winter-only simulation.
 The optimisation process found no advantage in installing solar when given
 only the winter conditions, which on average will be lower in terms of
 surface insolation due to the positioning of the Sun.
 The reliability on the whole is much higher for the winter-only simulation.
 Despite the winter-only scenario relying solely on wind power, moments
 of oversupply for winter-only peak at less than half that of the NEM-only
 simulation using all two years (Table.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Oversupp-Comp-Base-Winter"

\end_inset

).
 Gas, however, is utilised more in the winter-only simulation---peaking
 at 18GW and running at 10% capacity factor.
 Thus the winter-only simulation is able to exploit a more reliable wind
 resource, but in doing so is exposed to moments of low output that cannot
 be covered by excess hydro reserves and require large amounts of gas back-up.
 Given that the results shown in Figs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 are optimised it can also be concluded that the cost of installing solar
 to avoid some of those costly gas peaks is higher than simply paying for
 the use of the gas.

 are wide-spread along the northern coast of Queensland, which in comparison
 to South Australia (where most of the current NEM wind capacity is installed),
 is vastly higher and thus why the optimisation sought to install wind capacity
 (30.6GW/56GW) there.
 Another conclusion from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Winter-Averaged-U80"

\end_inset

 is that some of the installed capacity seen in the NEM-only simulation
 (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:NEM-Only-Installed-Cap"

\end_inset

) is clearly due to just the wintertime data.
 That is, the installed capacity of wind in northern Queensland for the
 NEM-only simulation is as a result of a clear wintertime maximum for that
 region.
 Significantly, this time of year is also the dry season in northern Australia.
 A problem that exists in installing wind capacity in the northern parts
 of Australia is the likelihood (over the lifetime of the wind farm) of
 exposure to damaging wind speeds from a tropical cyclone.
 However, what is clear from Fig.

 in northern Queensland do not come from the more active wet season.
 The next section optimises summertime data and the resources placement
 of this simulation will be shown to explain most of the resource placement
 of the NEM-only simulation not explained by the wintertime optimisation.

 As suggested earlier, what is clear from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Summer-Only-Installed-Cap"

\end_inset

 is that the characteristics of the installed capacity from the NEM-only
 simulation not explained by winter data are explained using the summertime
 data.
 For instance, solar is utilised in the summer-only simulation, while northern
 Queensland has no installed capacity of wind power.
 Rather, South Australia and north-west Tasmania are preferred locations
 for wind power in the summertime.
 Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Summer-Average-U80"

\end_inset

 illustrates that the preference for South Australian and north-west Tasmanian
 wind is not necessarily as a result of these regions peaking in the summer
 (intuitively, this would not make sense and is not seen in the average
 plots) but rather as a result of the average wind speeds dropping off in
 northern Queensland.

 Oversupply is very similar when comparing the summer to the winter-only

, in both summer and winter.
 This fact is unfortunate when considering the major population centres
 that the NEM services.
 What it does suggest though is that a NEM reliant on a large penetration
 of wind power needs to consider that it could be more cost effective to
 connect remote but high average wind speed locations to the existing powerline
 infrastructure.
 It may not be sufficient to simply spread-out wind resources across the
 NEM in the hope that a diversity in resource can overcome low average output
 from a single point.
 What is more intuitive from Figs.

\end_inset

 (and Fig.

\end_inset

) is that the connection of remote locations to the NEM with high wind availabil
ity, even if the locations are far from population centres, could be part
 of the optimal solution for high penetration RE.
 What is also clear from the comparison of the seasonal optimisations with
 the base NEM-only scenario is that the NEM-only scenario does not choose
 to compromise by utilising locations whose output is average throughout
 the year.
 Instead, the NEM-only solution maximised output by utilising the wintertime
 maximum in wind for northern Queensland, and then relying on southern wind
 installations during summer, irrespective of the drop-off in wind speed
 for northern Queensland in Summer.

Another distinction to make is the southern shift in solar capacity in the
 summer-only scenario when compared to the base NEM-only simulation.
 In the NEM-only simulation the optimisation chose to install all of the
 solar capacity in south-west Queensland.
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:All-And-Summer-DSR-Avgs"

a shows that this location has on average some of the best solar availability
 in the NEM region.
 However, the summertime data (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:All-And-Summer-DSR-Avgs"

\end_inset

b) shows a distinct southward shift in the solar maximum (to be expected)
 and this is reflected in the choice of location for solar capacity in the
 summer-only simulation.
 In both cases it is sufficient to simply install capacity at one of the
 highest average output locations (although the summer-only scenario uses
 two adjacent locations, one larger and one much smaller).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section explores the effect on the installed RE capacity (location
 and size) of increasing the penalty of connecting to the nearest capital
 city.
 The increased transmission penalties do not take into account power flow
 considerations, including voltage and node limitations, but are used as
 a guide for the GA to choose locations closer to the load centres (as per
 previous simulations).
 The hypothesis for conducting simulations with an increased connection
 cost is to test the quality of the remote resources.
 If, for instance, a small increase in penalty for connecting to the nearest
 capital city was to drastically contract RE resources towards the capital
 cities this would suggest that the benefit of utilising the higher quality
 remote resources is minimal.
 Contraction of resources towards the capital cities would also suggest
 that an alternative near-optimal configuration to that seen in the NEM-only
 was possible, but simply not found due to its slight increase in costs
 (based on the costs used in the NEM-only simulation).
 In this section three increased costs are tested: $2M/km, $4M/km and $8M/km.
 In each case the only difference in the configuration of the

 each resource, as well as the capacity factor of those resources in total,
 when compared to the original NEM-Only simulation.
 Thus what is clear from the 2X simulation is that the high installed capacity
 at remote locations in the the NEM-only simulation is a robust solution.
 Similar locations are utilised in the 2X simulation in spite of a doubling
 in the transmission penalty for connecting such remote locations.

In this section the cost of connecting to the nearest capital city for each
 of the locations in the NEM region of the ACCESS-A grid is further increased
 to $4M/km (hereafter referred to as the 4X simulation).
 Figs.

 and

 show the installed capacity and time series output of the optimised solution
 to the 4X simulation.
 Immediately obvious from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:4X-Intsalled-Capacity"

\end_inset

 is the loss of any solar capacity.
 Clearly the advantage of having solar connected to the NEM is not enough
 to warrant the extra cost of connecting the previously installed locations.
 It is surprising though that there appears to be no solar resource close
 enough to a capital city to warrant some installed capacity.
 The map of average DSR (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:All-And-Summer-DSR-Avgs"

\end_inset

) demonstrates that on average the solar resource does not have a large
 spatial variance across the Australian continent.
 In turn the output from nearby locations would be expected to correlate
 highly.
 Therefore the advantage in having any solar installed in the NEM without
 storage capacity is questionable.

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the wind installations in the 4X scenario it seems that similar
 regions are utilised when compared to both the 2X and NEM-only simulations.
 Most of the wind capacity is installed in northern Queensland, SA and Tasmania
 in the 4X scenario.
 There is also a slight increase in total installed wind capacity (Table.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:4X-Simulation-Stats"

\end_inset

), a small increase in gas usage and a small decrease in oversupply in the
 4X scenario when compared to 2X (Table.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Oversupp-Comp-Base-2X-4X"

\end_inset

).
 Despite little change in the performance of the 4X simulation there is
 a noticeable loss of the smaller wind sites utilised in 2X.
 Increasing the distance penalty in 4X shows that some of the wind sites
 utilised in 2X were limited in their benefit to the system.
 The increased connection penalty and the fact that system reliability is
 maintained in 4X indicates the contraction of wind resources to larger
 installations is a cost effective option (assuming a slight increase in
 gas usage is acceptable).
 This point is further explored in the next section where the connection
 cost is increased to $8M/km.

 What is very obvious from Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 is that the connection cost of $8M/km has crossed a threshold whereby the
 optimisation chooses to drastically limit the number of wind sites.
 This contraction of resources to four main regions indicates that any advantage
 gained by having smaller contributing wind sites in earlier scenarios is
 lost if the cost of connecting those sites is high enough.
 Table.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:8X-Simulation-Stats"

 illustrates that while there is very little change in the total wind capacity
 installed from 4X to 8X the contraction to four main locations and the
 subsequent increase in exposure to wind events (including the capturing
 of a cold front passing through South Australia only once, rather than
 several times) is covered by an increased use of gas back-up.

Comparing values in Table.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Oversupp-Comp-Base-2X-4X-8X"

\end_inset

 reveals that the oversupply statistics are relatively unchanged with respect
 to connection cost.
 However, the installed gas capacity increases from 16.7GW in the NEM-only
 simulation to 24.7GW in the 8X simulation.
 The increased reliance on gas is also visible when comparing the time series
 output from the 2X-8X scenarios (Figs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:2X-Time-Series"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:4X-Time-Series"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:8X-TIme-Series"

\end_inset

).
 There is a clear increase in the number and magnitude of moments when RE
 dips below demand as the connection cost increases.
 Thus it is possible to conclude that the role of smaller wind installations,
 and also the solar installation in 2X, is to cover some of the larger dips
 in wind output from the larger wind installations.
 And that this loss in diversity of output is covered by an increase in
 the gas output.

 wind events and that no amount of strategic resource placement is able
 to avoid exposure to such synoptic scale phenomena.

 These four large stations in the 8X scenario represent most of the RE variance
 seen in the earlier 4X, 2X and NEM-only simulations.

Further comparison between the base NEM-only scenario and the 8X scenario
 indicates that three of the four major locations utilised in the 8X were
 also utilised, but to a lesser extent, in the NEM-only scenario.
 This finding suggests that the optimisation was able to identify the independen
t wind regions in the standard transmission cost scenario, but that it took
 a large increase in transmission costs before the model was 'willing' to
 sample those regions at only one location each.
 Similar decorrelation characteristics can be found if the installations
 utilised in the NEM-only scenario are group together to form one time series
 for each 8X region.
 Table.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:NEM-Only-Cluster-Correlations"

\end_inset

 shows that each such cluster of smaller stations from the NEM-only scenario
 is at most correlated to a value of 0.09.
 Further evidence is thus provided for the existence of four distinct wind
 regions across the NEM region.

This chapter presents a comprehensive analysis of the covariance of the
 wind and solar fields via the simulation of an highly renewable

 dependent electrical network for, initially all of Australia, and then
 just eastern Australia (the NEM region).
 The optimisation of the whole of Australia produced a network of wind and
 solar stations spread throughout much of western and northern Australia.
 No connection cost that was tested was large enough to discourage the use
 of such remote locations (not shown) and thus the choice was made to limit
 the site selection to the participating states of the NEM, which services
 the vast majority of Australia's population.
 A base case was created for the NEM, termed the NEM-only scenario.
 
\change_inserted -1458100629 1418363495
Analysis of the output from the NEM-only scenario showed that two weather
 types (high centred south of WA and a heat low centred in the north west
 of WA) were associated with, while two other weather types (troughs through
 central and western Australia) were never associated with, very low RE
 output.
 
\change_unchanged
Various alternatives were then tested in order to gauge the robustness of
 the NEM-only solution and in order to reveal any seasonality in the region.
 Summer-only and winter-only simulations indicated that the Australian region
 experiences very distinct seasonal resource availability, with a very clear
 maximum in wind speed in northern Queensland during winter.
 Solar PV without storage was shown to be uncompetitive, at current costs,
 in the winter.
 Increasing the cost of transmission to $2M/km, $4M/km and $8M/km from $1M/km
 also resulted in the loss of any installed solar capacity, along with a
 contraction of wind resources to four separate regions with one large installat
ion each.
 The similarity in solution from the 2X in comparison to the NEM-only scenario
 illustrated a robustness in the NEM-only solution and transmission cost.
 The larger transmission costs also demonstrated that the smaller, dispersed,
 wind installations seen in the NEM-only base case were not needed if a
 small increase in gas usage was possible.
 However, analysis of the locations used in the NEM-only scenario showed
 that the optimiser, even at small transmission cost, was able to identify
 and utilise the synoptic scale wind variance.
 Correlating the four distinct wind regions showed a very small amount of
 shared variance, while maps of the decorrelation of the wind field demonstrated
 a decorrelation length scale of approximately the distance between each
 region's nearest neighbour (~884km).
