Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter presents an introduction to the general circulation of theStandarde
re and Australia's regional teleconnections.
 Following this there is a literature review of the synoptic climatology
 of the Australian region.
 Included in the literature review are studies that examine variability
 through pressure and geopotential height fields, but also studies whose
 focus is on wind and/or solar variability.
 The covariability of wind and solar and how the covariability can be driven
 by certain synoptic classifications is then explored.

ntal spatial scales (i.e.
 the size of Australia) the synoptic systems have the largest affect on
 the day-to-day variability of atmospheric variables like wind speed and
 solar irradiance; the synoptic scale encompasses spatial scales from 100s-1000s
 of kilometres and temporal scales from days to weeks.
 More commonly visualised by the distribution of high and low pressure centres,
 the synoptic scale describes the continuity of weather systems that stretch
 over vast continental-scale distances.
 The synoptic scale also provides a link between fundamental atmospheric
 dynamics like the Hadley cell and the pressure systems that affect local
 weather conditions (

, drives thermally direct circulations, including the Hadley cell
\change_unchanged
.
 In essence, circulations like the Hadley cell are formed through the need
 to balance energy and momentum across the Earth.
 The potential energy gained by the uplift of the Hadley circulation at
 the equator is converted to kinetic energy and largely dispersed into horizonta
l flows including the trade winds and mid-latitude westerlies (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Holton2003"

\end_inset

).
 These zonal flows are also momentum sources (easterly) and sinks (westerly).
 Momentum generated at the equator is transfered poleward through eddies
 and this eddy momentum flux is greatest near the mid-latitude jet around
 30ºS (

The mid-latitude jet is generated as a result of the meridional temperature
 gradient from equator to pole, which is greatest in the mid-latitudes,
 and it is the large-scale meander of the jet that can generate Rossby waves
 (along with planetary Rossby waves generated through friction with the
 surface of the Earth).
 The restoring force for a Rossby wave is the background meridional gradient
 in absolute vorticity-
\change_inserted -1458100629 1415684757
-
\change_unchanged
-a result of the change in Coriolis force with latitude (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Holton2004"

\end_inset

).
 Any parcel of air displaced meridionally will cause oscillations in the
 vorticity field, which then propagate in a westward direction with the
 mean flow (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Holton2004"

\end_inset

).
 Such propagating oscillations can be visualised on the synoptic scale as
 high and low pressure systems.

In Australia, very contrasting synoptic conditions can often occur simultaneousl
 for blocking motinent.
 Stretching from about 10ºS to 44ºS the Australian continent is subject
 to both tropical weather systems as well as ‘polar outbreaks’ from cold
 fronts associated with cyclones from the southern hemisphere storm track
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Meteorology2011b"

\end_inset

).
 Much of the Australian continent is classified as desert and can thus experienc
e prolonged periods of fine/sunny weather while some regions of northern
 Australia (as well as the west coast of Tasmania) can experience in excess
 of three metres of rain each year (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Meteorology2009"

\end_inset

).
 The northern regions of Australia are considered to only have two seasons
 each year (wet and dry---according to the position of the monsoon belt)
 and can often have quite invariant weather during the dry season (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Meteorology2011b"

\end_inset

).
 Most of the population of Australia, however, resides in the more temperate
 regions where four seasons occur in every year.

 Ashcroft et al.
 (2014) found there to be considerable fluctuation in the climatological
 parameters of SEA.
 In particular the relationship between rainfall for SEA and large-scale
 climate drivers, including the El Nino Southern Ocscillation

 depending on seasont 150 years.
 For instance, a drop in ENSO variability during the 1920-1959 period when
 compared to the preceeding and following decades resulted in a break-down
 in the ENSO-rainfall relationship of SEA.
 The 1920-1959 period instead saw more influence from other factors including
 the Southern Annular Mode

(SAM) and local pressure variations.
 Over a similar time-frame Alexander et al.
 (2011) found there to be a significant decline in the storminess (defined
 as 95 and 99 percentiles of a geostrophically derived wind speed) for SEA.
 Since the late 19th century Alexander et al.
 (2011) also found strong decadal variability in storminess.
 Alexander et al.
 (2011) found that the drop-off in storminess was consistent with a southward
 shift in the southern hemisphere storm tracks---a similar finding to that
 of Frederiksen and Frederiksen (2011).

In recent decades such a shift in the southern hemispheric storm tracks
 also coincides with the southward migration of the subtropical ridge---found
 in Timbal and Drodowski (2013).

 The anticyclones from the Bight then tend to migrate north-eastward over

More recently Timbal and Drodowski (2013) found that a strengthening in
 the subtropical ridge to be linked to two thirds of the 1997-2009 decline
 in SEA rainfall.
 In fact, a strengthening in the subtropical ridge was seen to preceed the
 two most recent droughts for southern Australia (1935-1945 and 1997-2009;
 Timbal and Drodowski, 2013).

The Tasman Sea, south west of New Zealand, is also a common location for
 so-called ‘blocking highs’.
 Blocking highs are said to be long-lived high pressure systems (lasting
 for more than about five days) that are associated with an anomalous breakdown
 in the prevailing westerly flow (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt

\change_deleted -1458100629 1423721912
Iijima2009
\change_inserted -1458100629 1423721917
The decay
\change_unchanged
 of the blocking high can also be followed by a re-intensification shortly
 thereafter (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "Sinclair1996"

\end_inset

).
 According to geostrophic theory such blocking highs in the Tasman Sea would
 likely produce prolonged periods of onshore flow for eastern/south eastern
 Australia (although ridging of high pressure from the blocking centre could
 indicate stable conditions over much of the eastern and central Australian
 continent instead).
 
\change_inserted -1458100629 1415861987
Frederiksen and Frederiksen (2011) studied synoptic precursers to blocking
 in the southern hemisphere.
 The authors found that recent increases in the growth rate of onset-of-blocking
 regimes was at least partially reflective of a general reduction in the
 baroclinicity of the southern hemisphere subtropical regions (comparing
 and wind speed/power in Australia, ding decades).
 Such a decline in the baroclinicity of the subtropical jet was also seen
 to lead to reductions in the prevelance of storm-track synoptic modes.

 In terms of wind speed, the unstable regimes are potentially more advantageous

 geostrophic wind speeds.
 In Australia there are two main types of low pressure systems that affect
 the weather: tropical and extra-tropical or mid-latitude cyclones (although
 transitions between the two types are not uncommon (

 Tropical systems are normally associated with the Inter-Tropical Convergence

 Solar irradiance is also likely to be negatively impacted by the presence

 In the northern regions of Australia heat lows, which form as a result
 of continental heating, are also common in summer (

 However, heat lows generally do not have as large a pressure gradient as

The other more common type of cyclone likely to affect wind speed and solar

 In winter there tends to be a broader storm track (

\change_inserted -1458100629 1415855136
 However, a more recent study by Frederiksen and Frederiksen (2011) has
 shown a reduction in the growth rate of storm track related synoptic modes
 explicitly decades (where growth rates indicate the likelihood of a mode
 to develop into a mature system).
 Frederiksen and Frederiksen (2011) found recent reductions in rainfall
 for the southern parts of Australia to be consistent with the observed
 reductions in growth rate of cyclogenisis and storm track modes.
 Further, significant decreases in growth rate of onset-of-blocking modes
 to be related to reduced rainfall over the east coast because of the tendency
 for blocking modes to spawn East Coast Lows (Frederiksen and Frederisken,
 2011).

(ECLs), a form of extra-tropical cyclone, represent a significant influence
 on the weather of the east coast of Australia, where the vast majority
 of Australians live.
 ECLs form through various processes that include inland troughs, following
 waves of a mid-latitude front and also from ex-tropical cyclones (Speer
 et al.
 2009).
 ECLs are most common during cooler months for southern regions and warmer
 months for northern regions of the eastern seaboard (Pepler et al.
 2014).
 ECLs bring high wind speeds and are responsible for 35-45% of all rainfall
 along the eastern seaboard during winter (Pepler et al.
 2014).
 ECLs also have little relationship with the large-scale climate drivers
 (including ENSO and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "IOD"
description "Indian Ocean Dipole"

\end_inset

).
 As such the rainfall of the eastern seaboard has a limited correlation
 with ENSO and IOD (Pepler et al.
 2014).
 More significant for the formation of ECLs is the position of the subtropical
 ridge (Timbal 2010).
 A more southerly position to the subtropical ridge is likely to favour
 rainfall for the northern eastern seaboard due to the easterly flow, which
 then favours the formation of easterly and inland throughs lows---such
 lows account for 71% of significant rainfall for the NSW coast (Timbal
 2010; Speer et al.
 2009).

 Given then, the numerous studies all suggesting a storm track or cyclone

 studies proposing a significant synoptic mode of variability in this region.

 For the period 1976-1986

 compared wind speed/wind run observations from Perth and Esperance with

 synoptic class on wind speed and also potential wind power output.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 the synoptic classes referred to whether or not an anticyclone or cyclone
 (and cold front) was the major influence on the weather at the time.
 The authors found that the most common synoptic states related to high
 pressure systems either to the west, east, or ridging directly above the
 region of concern (south-west Western Australia

 Consequently the synoptic classes that produce the most power throughout
 the year were those where an anticyclone is situated to the west and where
 ridging of high pressure is directly above (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Lyons1989"

).
 Surprisingly, the authors observed that the synoptic classes involving
 the highest wind speeds (cyclonic classes) did not produce significant
 amounts of power on an annual basis.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Lyons1989"

\end_inset

 noted that the observed lower output from cyclonic classes was partly due
 to the lower frequency of the cyclonic systems, but also due to the fact
 that afternoon sea-breezes were generated under anticyclonic conditions---thus
 making anticyclonic regimes a larger contributor to yearly total power
 output.

 To determine the synoptic influences on wind speed for the rest of Australia

 The global trend in DSR could have even been heightened in Australia given
 the positive association between subsidence and fine weather, and the evidence
 suggesting circulations like the Hadley cell have been increasing in strength
 in recent decades (

 in their study of Australian observational data found that solar radiation
 values could be accurately predicted using proxies like rainfall and temperatur
e, however, little mention was made as to the characteristics of solar radiation
 for the continent.
 For Australia it is therefore possible to conclude that there is a large
 intra-annual cycle in solar radiation across the continent, that DSR could
 be enhanced under El Nino conditions and that over recent decades the amount
 of surface DSR may have increased.
 To make more specific assessments about the variability of solar radiation
 in Australia would, however, require a much more in-depth investigation.
 It is part of the purpose of the current study to undertake such a detailed
 investigation and to thus reveal the potential for Australia to extract

There does not appear to be any study in the literature that directly compares
 wind speed and solar radiation variability over Australia.
 Even when considering investigations into only wind speed or only solar
 radiation variability the depth of research is still poor.
 Thus an insight into the covariance between wind speed and solar radiation
 from the literature is only possible by comparing the general characteristics
 found from research into each variable separately.

 observed that due to the sea-breeze effect instances of high pressure ridging
 directly above south-west WA were the second most influential synoptic
 state for positive wind power production in Perth.
 Yet in general terms anticyclones are the bearer of fine weather and light
 winds.
 Therefore, one conclusion that could be made from the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is that under the influence of a ridging anticyclone coastal regions can
 have a positive covariance between wind speed and solar irradiance (or
 rather, that sunny conditions can coincide with windy conditions).
 This type of positive covariance could be advantageous for an hybrid

 For instance, an hybrid system exposed to a sunny and windy day could disperse

In terms of the findings from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, one can also conclude that determinations of wind speed based purely from
 knowledge of the distribution of pressure are not necessarily very accurate.
 Knowledge of the local conditions in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 brought about a better understanding of wind speed variability which most
 likely would have been missed by a simple analysis of the large scale forcing.
 Thus one could argue that any conclusions made from analysis of the pressure
 fields must be qualified by noting the potential influence of local effects.
 However, the modifying of wind speeds by local conditions like the sea-breeze
 is likely to be less relevant for locations away from an anticyclonic centre
 (where geostrophic forcing is greater).

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 there should be extratropical cyclones that, particularly in winter-time,
 influence atmospheric conditions in the southern latitudes of Australia.
 For example, the southern regions of Australia (~29-44ºS) have a typical
 cyclone density of close to one cyclone for the whole region during both
 summer and winter (

LatexCommand citealp

; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp

).
 In terms of the northern regions of Australia, cyclone system densities
 (most likely tropical and thermal systems) commonly exceed double that
 of the southern regions (

).
 Given then that the low pressure centres are usually associated with cold
 fronts or troughs and bands of convection it is likely that there would
 be relatively high winds and below average levels of DSR, during each of
 the cyclonic events mentioned above---indicating the strong possibility
 for a negative covariance to exist between wind speed and solar irradiance
 for regions under the influence of such cyclonic systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Analysing some of the literature into the potential synoptic influences
 on wind speed and solar irradiance suggests that anticyclonic regimes may
 be responsible for driving both a positive and negative covariance between
 wind speed and solar irradiance, while cyclonic regimes are most likely
 responsible for a negative covariance.
 Under anticyclonic regimes, coastal regions may experience both sunny weather
 and relatively high wind speeds due to local effects and that such a covariance
 could be advantageous to a hybrid

 However, this analysis of some of the literature is far from being quantitative
ly robust.
 A more comprehensive study would still be needed in order to quantify the
 general covariance of wind speed and solar irradiance over Australia; enabling

In the following sections of this thesis an introduction to the methods
 used, climate data-set used and results for Part 1 of this thesis are presented
 in order to highlight the climatological covariance of wind speed/power
 and solar irradiance/power over the Australian region.
 It should be noted at this point, however, that the current report focuses
 more on the large-scale spatial covariance/spatial distribution of climatologic
al wind speed/power and solar irradiance over Australia; the term covariance,
 mentioned throughout, suggests a time-wise comparison of the fields that
 is not directly addressed in this thesis.
