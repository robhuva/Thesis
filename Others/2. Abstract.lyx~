Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometime in the future Australia will undoubtedly need to rely on significant
 amounts of Renewable Energy (RE) for electricity.
 Fossil fuels are inherently non-renewable and their dwindling supply will
 force investment in alternatives.
 There is therefore a need to research how such increased penetrations of
 RE resources will be managed.
 Installed across large areas, a National Electricity Market (NEM) with
 increased contributions from RE will be affected by large-scale meteorological
 variability.
 The synoptic scale (100s-1,000s of km and days-weeks) weather systems are
 of particular interest.
 This thesis examines how synoptic scale weather variability might affect
 a future highly RE dependent Australia using two approaches.
 Approach one (Part 1 of the thesis) identifies the common synoptic scale
 weather systems from a reanalysis data set (ERA-Interim) and then analyses
 the availability of wind and solar energy associated with each weather
 type.
 Approach two (Part 2) utilises data from a regional model (ACCESS-A) as
 part of an energy model that maximises the contribution of wind and solar
 energy in meeting the demand of Australia.
 The influence of the weather systems identified in Part 1 on the optimised
 energy network is then analysed.

Part 1 of this thesis utilises the European Centre for Medium Range Weather
 Forecasting (ECMWF) reanalysis product ERA-Interim from 1989-2009 and for
 the Austral region (6ºS,105ºE) → (49.5ºS,165ºE).
 The Self-Organising Map (SOM) technique is then used to identify commonly
 occurring features in the ERA-Interim Mean Sea-Level Pressure (MSLP) field.
 The SOM technique converts the time series of MSLP to a time series of
 commonly occurring MSLP patterns, or weather types.
 The weather types are then analysed for their tendency to be associated
 with either high or low wind and solar potential.
 Some autumnal MSLP patterns are shown to be associated with very low wind
 speeds and solar irradiance for most of the Australian continent, while
 other summertime patterns show good potential for extracting wind and solar
 energy.
 Following this an analysis of just the wind field demonstrates that decorrelati
on in the wind field is reached at a distance of approximately 1,300km.

\begin_layout Standard
Part 2 of this thesis focuses on optimising renewable energy capacity to
 meet electrical demand, using data from the Bureau of Meteorology’s high-resolu
tion regional weather model, ACCESS-A, for the period 2010-2011.
 The ACCESS-A data, in tandem with electrical demand data from the Australian
 Electricity Market Operator and a Genetic Algorithm, are utilised to investigat
e the influence of synoptic scale variability on a RE network.
 By optimising generation to meet electrical demand the output of both wind
 and solar installations from locations across the ACCESS-A grid it is shown
 that some of the weather types identified in Part 1 either adversely or
 favourably affect net output.
 A late autumn and a summer weather type are shown to be significantly associate
d with very low RE output.
 The persistence and re-occurrence of low RE events shows that most episodes
 of low RE last for less than six hours and such low RE events have a mean
 return period of more than a week.
 Increasing the cost of transmission results in installed RE capacity contractin
g to four large wind stations and it is shown that the NEM region exhibits
 four distinct wind regimes.
 The wind regimes are highly uncorrelated and the minimum distance between
 regime locations reflects a smaller decorrelation length (884km) than that
 found in Part 1.

\begin_layout Standard
In combination, Parts 1 and 2 of this thesis illustrate some of the issues
 that a future high penetration RE network might need to overcome.
 Knowledge of the influence of detrimental/favourable weather phenomena
 will be critical when designing and/or maintaining a large-scale renewable
 energy network for Australia--in particular, knowledge of the decorrelation
 length-scale in the wind field.
