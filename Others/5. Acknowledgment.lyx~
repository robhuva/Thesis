Acknowledgments

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis was funded by a Melbourne Research Scholarship whose departmental
 component was supplied by the bursary afforded to Roger Dargaville from
 the Melbourne Energy Institute (MEI).

\begin_layout Standard
I would first and foremost like to acknowledge the support--intellectual,
 spiritual and monetary--of my supervisors, Roger Dargaville and Peter Rayner.
 No doubt the work would not have been possible without your guidance and
 for this I am forever grateful.
 To the other members of my PhD advisory committee, Todd Lane and John Moreau,
 thank you for your input to the project and your support as well.
 I would also like to acknowledge the Australian Renewable Energy Association
 grant no.
 002489 and MEI for providing the funds that allowed me to attend the necessary
 international conferences.

\begin_layout Standard
Setting up and getting the the Self-Organising Map working was made remarkably
 easy due to the generous help of Petteri Uotila of the CSIRO, and for this
 I am thankful.
 Marcelle Gannon was integral in the latter stages of this thesis for her
 help in managing the Genetic Algorithm (GA) code, while I also acknowledge
 the work of Stephen Thomas in writing the original GA code.
 I would like to thank the IT staff (principally Brett Holman and Doug Morrison)
 for their help with various IT issues over the years, but in particular
 with their efforts in the wake of server crashes.

\begin_layout Standard
To my close Family (Denise, Ronald and Amy) and friends (Stuart, Lyndon
 and Jenny) thank you for the integral roles that you have played over the
 years.
 Your unwavering support kept me sane and allowed me to work more effectively
 while at uni.
 To the other members of the Melbourne Academy of Sustainability and Society
 (MASS--specifically Katrin, Sam and Sophie) thank you for your PhD insights
 and for the intellectual stimulation you provided away from this thesis.
 And lastly thank you to the current (Jan, Daniel, Lotta, Ben and Adam)
 and past (Linden, Helen, Erin, Andrea and Sara) room 311 office-mates,
 along with many other fellow Postgrads of the department for your banter
 and friendship.
