My most sincere thanks to my supervisor, Assoc.
 Professor Kevin Walsh whose broad knowledge of the field always kept me

 I also extend my appreciation to the two other members of my PhD advisory
 committe, Professor Ian Simmonds and Dr.
 Todd Lane, for their guidance.
 I greatly appreciate Dr.
 John Bye's initial recomendation to do my PhD research in the School of
 Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne.
