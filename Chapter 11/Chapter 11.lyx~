 (RE) resources (for instance, geothermal, biomass and pumped hydro).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Point 1 will allow for an increase in the reliance on RE without the further
 exposure to atmospheric variability.
 This is an important consideration if the aim of a future Australian electricit
y network is to rely heavily---potentially 100%---on RE resources.

 An investigation into whether the drivers of demand and RE output are correlate
d.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Point 2 is an important aspect of the variability in RE that would have
 been addressed in this thesis had time permitted.
 For instance, a question that arises from the consideration of point 2
 is whether or not it was possible that some of the high demand days in
 Part 2 were offset by high output from RE.
 And then if so, what the meteorological reasons were for such a relationship.

3.
 An investigation into the implications of projected climate change on resource
 availability and any changes to the relationship between wind and solar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Point 3 arises from the expectation that shifts in the nature and positioning
 of weather systems occur in the future due to anthropogenic climate change.

 note an expected southward shift in the position of the subtropical ridge
 while 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 note a similar shift in the mid-latitude storm track.
 With these points in mind it is reasonable to suggest that some of the
 weather regimes analysed in this thesis also exhibit changes in their 
\change_inserted -1458100629 1423631139
mean 
\change_unchanged
positioning.
 A question that arises from this point would be: does this type of latitudinal
 shift in the climatological positioning of weather systems then alter the
 resource availability in the NEM region? And if so, how quickly this happens
 will be important.
 A change in resource availability that occurs too quickly might result
 in stranded assets.
 A region that was once identified as having a superior RE resource might
 cease to have such a quality resource.
 In this case, contributions from other, or even new installations, would
 be needed in order to maintain supply.
 This last point would be quite costly.

It would be important to investigate the implication of having more extreme
 behaviour in RE output on an electrical network that relies on RE to meet
 demand.
 In particular, similar to point 2, if the extremes in the weather also
 cause more demand for electricity

 would likely to result in much higher demand for electricity in order to
 keep homes and businesses at comfortable temperatures.
 Furthermore, would an increase in extreme RE output put new and significant
 stresses on the electrical network? This too could be costly and thus requires
 investigation.

4.
 Simulations using imperfect demand forecasts and financial models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Point 4 would involve the optimiser being fed demand data that contained
 a small random component.
 The random component to demand would imitate reality and likely result
 in the use of more back-up resources.
 Further to this it would be possible to operate a financial model for each
 resource centre---as part of a new simulation.
 The inclusion of a financial model would also ensure that each installation
 was financially viable and would likely concentrate resources away from
 the smaller RE stations.

5.
 Analysis of excluded time steps and their relationship to RE output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the process of assigning SOM-based weather types to the 2010-2011
 period some hours had no weather type assigned because of an ambiguous
 relationship to the SOM.
 What was not explored in this thesis is the relationship of these excluded
 time steps with RE output, and also RE-Demand.
 It is possible with further analysis to reveal if some of these excluded
 hours were important hours for the NEM (i.e.
 for reasons of over or undersupply).
 Comparison of the results from such a study with that found in this thesis
 would be useful in order to reveal any differences between the influence
 on RE output from common weather patterns, as opposed to extremes.
 Although it should be noted that over 93% of time steps had a SOM node
 match that survived filtering in the continental case, leaving a small
 population of extreme samples to examine.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By utilising a Self-Organising Map (SOM) of the ERA-Interim 1989-2009 Mean
 Sea-Level Pressure (MSLP) field over Australia a series of commonly occurring
 features of the synoptic scale MSLP were determined.
 The time series of MSLP from ERA-Interim was then converted to a time series
 of archetypal weather patterns.
 Some of the common regimes were then shown to produce concurrently high
 wind and solar output, while others were associated with, on average, limited
 wind and solar potential.
 Analysis of just the wind field from ERA-Interim showed that decorrelation
 was reached by spatial separation of approximately 1,300-1,400km.

 model was built.
 The

 model was given wind and solar data for 2010-2011 from the ACCESS-A regional
 model and historical demand data from the Australian Electricity Market
 Operator.
 When given the chance to optimise the whole of Australia the

\change_inserted -1458100629 1418779942

\change_unchanged
 model chose to install most of the RE in remote Western Australia (WA).
 Available locations to be optimised were then limited to the NEM region
 because no realistic penalty could be applied to deter the

energy
\change_inserted -1458100629 1418779943

\change_unchanged
 model from using such unrealistic WA locations.
 A base NEM-only scenario was then produced.
 The NEM-only scenario with standard transmission costs showed some preference
 for locations closer to the capital cities.
 However, the largest wind installation (northern Queensland) and the only
 solar installation from the base NEM-only scenario were still long distances
 from the nearest demand centre.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By conducting optimisations using data from either the Austral summer and
 winter it was revealed that some very distinct summer-only and winter-only
 features were responsible for the distribution of resources seen in the
 base scenario.
 In particular, the non-use of north Queensland in the summer-only optimisation
 showed that the north Queensland wind resources is a wintertime (dry season)
 only phenomenon.
 The lack of installed solar capacity in the wintertime optimisation also
 showed that the standard transmission cost was too large a cost impediment
 to justify any use of solar photovoltaics in the wintertime.
 Scenarios of the whole 2010-2011 period that utilised increased transmission
 penalties also revealed that the solar resource, without storage, was not
 good enough to justify significantly larger connection costs.
 The scenarios with increased connection costs also resulted in the contraction
 of wind resources to four distinct regions (north Queensland, Brisbane,
 north-west Tasmania and South Australia).
 The four wind regimes were then shown to be highly uncorrelated, reinforcing
 their usefulness in combining to meet demand, but also providing an optimisatio
n-based decorrelation length scale of approximately 884km.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While it was possible to conclude from just the analysis in Part 1 that
 some synoptic regimes had the potential to be problematic for RE output,
 integral to the analysis was the optimisation in Part 2.
 Part 2 enabled the identification of specific moments in time where RE
 output was diminished.
 Such specifics were impossible to determine from solely the climatology.
 In tandem the two parts combine to allow for both the analysis of conditions
 that are challenging for RE output and the synoptic causes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis it has been shown that the potential for Australia to extract

\change_inserted -1458100629 1418779944

 from the wind and solar fields is high.
 By approaching the question of how the wind and solar resources vary at
 various spatio-temporal resolutions from two different approaches it was
 concluded that a high reliance on RE in the National Electricity Market
 region is possible, but that there were some large-scale features (synoptic
 weather patterns and decorrelation length scales) of the atmosphere over
 Australia that need to be taken into account when designing and operating
 such an RE-based network.
